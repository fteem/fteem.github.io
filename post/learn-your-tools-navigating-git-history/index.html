In fact, most of us are facing (somewhat) legacy codebases on a daily basis, and regaining the context of why some feature, or line of code exists in the codebase is very important. This is where git, the distributed version control system, is invaluable. Let’s dive in and see how we can use our git history and easily navigate through it.\nGit history First and foremost, what is git history? As the name says, it is the commit history of a git repo. It contains a bunch of commit messages, with their authors' name, the commit hash and the date of the commit. The easiest way to see the history of a git repo, is the git log command.\nSidenote: For the purpose of this post, we will use Ruby on Rails' repo, the master branch. The reason behind this is because Rails has a very good git history, with nice commit messages, references and explanations behind every change. Given the size of the codebase, the age and the number of maintainers, it’s certainly one of the best repositories that I have seen. Of course, I am not saying there are no other repositories built with good git practices, but this is one that has caught my eye.\nSo back to Rails' repo. If you run git log in the Rails' repo, you will see something like this:\ncommit 66ebbc4952f6cfb37d719f63036441ef98149418 Author: Arthur Neves  Date: Fri Jun 3 17:17:38 2016 -0400 Dont re-define class SQLite3Adapter on test We were declaring in a few tests, which depending of the order load will cause an error, as the super class could change. see https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ac1c4e141b20c1067af2c2703db6e1b463b985da#commitcomment-17731383 commit 755f6bf3d3d568bc0af2c636be2f6df16c651eb1 Merge: 4e85538 f7b850e Author: Eileen M.

A tip: if git log is a bit scarse or complicated to use, or maybe you are just bored, I recommend checking out various git GUIs and command line tools. In the past I’ve used GitX which was very good, but since the command line feels like home to me, after trying tig I’ve never looked back.\nFinding Nemo So now, since we know the bare minimum of the git log command, let’s see how we can explore the history more effectively in our everyday work.\nLet’s say, hypothetically, we are suspecting an unexpected behaviour in the String#classify method and we want to find how and where it has been implemented.\nOne of the first commands that you can use, to see where the method is defined, is git grep. Simply said, this command prints out lines that match a certain pattern. Now, to find the definition of the method, it’s pretty simple - we can grep for def classify and see what we get:\n➜ git grep 'def classify' activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/inflections.rb: def classify activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb: def classify(table_name) tools/profile: def classify Now, although we can already see where our method is created, we are not sure on which line it is. If we add the -n flag to our git grep command, git will provide the line numbers of the match:\n➜ git grep -n 'def classify' activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/inflections.rb:205: def classify activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:186: def classify(table_name) tools/profile:112: def classify Much better, right? Having the context in mind, we can easily figure out that the method that we are looking for lives in activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/inflections.rb, on line 205. The classify method, in all of it’s glory looks like this:\n# Creates a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table names to models. # Note that this returns a string and not a class. (To convert to an actual class # follow +classify+ with +constantize+.) # # 'ham_and_eggs'.classify # = \"HamAndEgg\" # 'posts'.classify # = \"Post\" def classify ActiveSupport::Inflector.classify(self) end Although the method we found is the one we usually call on Strings, it invokes another method on the ActiveSupport::Inflector, with the same name. Having our git grep result available, we can easily navigate there, since we can see the second line of the result being activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb on line 186. The method that we are are looking for is:\n# Creates a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table # names to models. Note that this returns a string and not a Class (To # convert to an actual class follow +classify+ with #constantize). # # classify('ham_and_eggs') # = \"HamAndEgg\" # classify('posts') # = \"Post\" # # Singular names are not handled correctly: # # classify('calculus') # = \"Calculus\" def classify(table_name) # strip out any leading schema name camelize(singularize(table_name.to_s.sub(/.*\\./, ''.freeze))) end Boom! Given the size of Rails, finding this should not take us more than 30 seconds with the help of git grep.\nSo, what changed last? Now, since we have the method available, we need to figure out what were the changes that this file has gone through. The since we know the correct file name and line number, we can use git blame. This command shows what revision and author last modified each line of a file. Let’s see what were the latest changes made to this file:\ngit blame activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb Whoa! Although we get the last change of every line in the file, we are more interested in the specific method (lines 176 to 189). Let’s add a flag to the git blame command, that will show the blame of just those lines. Also, we will add the -s (suppress) option to the command, to skip the author names and the timestamp of the revision (commit) that changed the line:\ngit blame -L 176,189 -s activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb 9fe8e19a 176) # Creates a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table 5ea3f284 177) # names to models. Note that this returns a string and not a Class (To 9fe8e19a 178) # convert to an actual class follow +classify+ with #constantize). 51cd6bb8 179) # 6d077205 180) # classify('ham_and_eggs') # = \"HamAndEgg\" 9fe8e19a 181) # classify('posts') # = \"Post\" 51cd6bb8 182) # 51cd6bb8 183) # Singular names are not handled correctly: 5ea3f284 184) # 66d6e7be 185) # classify('calculus') # = \"Calculus\" 51cd6bb8 186) def classify(table_name) 51cd6bb8 187) # strip out any leading schema name 5bb1d4d2 188) camelize(singularize(table_name.to_s.sub(/.*\\./, ''.freeze))) 51cd6bb8 189) end The output of the git blame command now shows all of the file lines and their respective revisions. Now, to see a specific revision, or in other words, what each of those revisions changed, we can use the git show command. When supplied a revision hash (like 66d6e7be) as an argument, it will show you the full revision, with the author name, timestamp and the whole revision in it’s glory. Let’s see what actually changed at the latest revision that changed line 188:\ngit show 5bb1d4d2 Whoa! Did you test that? If you didn’t, it’s an awesome commit by Schneems that made a very interesting performance optimization by using frozen strings, which makes sense in our current context. But, since we are on this hypothetical debugging session, this doesn’t tell much about our current problem. So, how can we see what changes has our method under investigation gone through?\nSearching the logs Now, we are back to the git log. The question is, how can we see all the revisions that the classify method went under?\nThe git log command is quite powerful, because it has a rich list of options to apply to it. We can try to see what the git log has stored for this file, using the -p options, which means show me the patch for this entry in the git log:\ngit log -p activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb This will show us a big list of revisions, for every revision of this file. But, just like before, we are interested in the specific file lines. Let’s modify the command a bit, to show us what we need:\ngit log -L 176,189:activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb The git log command accepts the -L option, which takes the lines range and the filename as arguments. The format might be a bit weird for you, but it translates to:\ngit log -L ,: When we run this command, we can see the list of revisions for these lines, which will lead us to the first revision that created the method:\ncommit 51xd6bb829c418c5fbf75de1dfbb177233b1b154 Author: Foo Bar  Date: Tue Jun 7 19:05:09 2011 -0700 Refactor diff --git a/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb b/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb --- a/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb +++ b/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb @@ -58,0 +135,14 @@ + # Create a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table names to models. + # Note that this returns a string and not a Class. (To convert to an actual class + # follow +classify+ with +constantize+.) + # + # Examples: + # \"egg_and_hams\".classify # = \"EggAndHam\" + # \"posts\".classify # = \"Post\" + # + # Singular names are not handled correctly: + # \"business\".classify # = \"Busines\" + def classify(table_name) + # strip out any leading schema name + camelize(singularize(table_name.to_s.sub(/.*\\./, ''))) + end Now, look at that - it’s a commit from 2011. Practically, git allows us to travel back in time. This is a very good example of why a proper commit message is paramount to regain context, because from the commit message we cannot really regain context of how this method came to be. But, on the flip side, you should never ever get frustrated about it, because you are looking at someone that basically gives away his time and energy for free, doing open source work.\nComing back from that tangent, we are not sure how the initial implementation of the classify method came to be, given that the first commit is just a refactor. Now, if you are thinking something within the lines of “but maybe, just maybe, the method was not on the line range 176 to 189, and we should look more broadly in the file”, you are very correct. The revision that we saw said “Refactor” in it’s commit message, which means that the method was actually there, but after that refactor it started to exist on that line range.\nSo, how can we confirm this? Well, believe it or not, git comes to the rescue again. The git log command accepts the -S option, which looks for the code change (additions or deletions) for the specified string as an argument to the command. This means that, if we call git log -S classify, we can see all of the commits that changed a line that contains that string.\nIf you call this command in the Rails repo, you will first see git slowing down a bit. But, when you realise that git actually parses all of the revisions in the repo to match the string, it’s actually super fast. Again, the power of git at your fingertips. So, to find the first version of the classify method, we can run:\ngit log -S 'def classify' This will return all of the revisions where this method has been introduced or changed. If you were following along, the last commit in the log that you will see is:\ncommit db045dbbf60b53dbe013ef25554fd013baf88134 Author: David Heinemeier Hansson foo@bar.com Date: Wed Nov 24 01:04:44 2004 +0000 Initial git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@4 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de How cool is that? It’s the initial commit to Rails, made on a svn repo by DHH! This means that classify has been around since the beginning of (Rails) time. Now, to see the commit with all of it’s changes, we can run:\ngit show db045dbbf60b53dbe013ef25554fd013baf88134 Great, we got to the bottom of it. Now, by using the output from git log -S 'def classify' you can track the changes that have happened to this method, combined with the power of the git log -L command.\nUntil next time Sure, we didn’t really fix any bugs, because we were trying some git commands and following along the evolution of the classify method. But, nevertheless, git is a very powerful tool that we all must learn to use and to embrace.

and the date of when the commit was created. Of course, <code>git</code> being super
customisable, it allows you to customise the output format of the <code>git log</code>
command. Let&rsquo;s say, we want to just see the first line of the commit message,
we could run <code>git log --oneline</code>, which will produce a more compact log:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-text data-lang=text>66ebbc4 Dont re-define class SQLite3Adapter on test

14ff8e7 Fix debug helper test</code></pre></div><p>To see all of the <code>git log</code> options, I recommend checking out manpage of
<code>git log</code>, available in your terminal via <code>man git-log</code> or <code>git help log</code>.
A tip: if <code>git log</code> is a bit scarse or complicated to use, or maybe you are just
bored, I recommend checking out various <code>git</code> GUIs and command line tools. In
the past I&rsquo;ve used <a href=http://gitx.frim.nl/>GitX</a> which was very good, but since
the command line feels like home to me, after trying
<a href=https://github.com/jonas/tig>tig</a> I&rsquo;ve never looked back.</p><h2 id=finding-nemo>Finding Nemo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#finding-nemo>#</a></h2><p>So now, since we know the bare minimum of the <code>git log</code> command, let&rsquo;s see how
we can explore the history more effectively in our everyday work.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say, hypothetically, we are suspecting an unexpected behaviour in the
<code>String#classify</code> method and we want to find how and where it has been
implemented.</p><p>One of the first commands that you can use, to see where the method is defined,
is <code>git grep</code>. Simply said, this command prints out lines that match a certain
pattern. Now, to find the definition of the method, it&rsquo;s pretty simple - we can
grep for <code>def classify</code> and see what we get:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>➜  git grep <span style=color:#2aa198>&#39;def classify&#39;</span>

activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:    def classify<span style=color:#719e07>(</span>table_name<span style=color:#719e07>)</span>
tools/profile:    def classify</code></pre></div><p>Now, although we can already see where our method is created, we are not sure
on which line it is. If we add the <code>-n</code> flag to our <code>git grep</code> command, <code>git</code>
will provide the line numbers of the match:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>➜  git grep -n <span style=color:#2aa198>&#39;def classify&#39;</span>

tools/profile:112:    def classify</code></pre></div><p>Much better, right? Having the context in mind, we can easily figure out that
the method that we are looking for lives in <code>activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/inflections.rb</code>, on line 205. The <code>classify</code> method, in all of it&rsquo;s glory looks like
this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-ruby data-lang=ruby><span style=color:#586e75># Creates a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table names to models.</span>

another method on the <code>ActiveSupport::Inflector</code>, with the same name. Having our

second line of the result being
<code>activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb</code> on line 186. The method
that we are are looking for is:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-ruby data-lang=ruby><span style=color:#586e75># Creates a class name from a plural table name like Rails does for table</span>

seconds with the help of <code>git grep</code>.</p><h2 id=so-what-changed-last>So, what changed last?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#so-what-changed-last>#</a></h2><p>Now, since we have the method available, we need to figure out what were the
changes that this file has gone through. The since we know the correct file name
and line number, we can use <code>git blame</code>. This command shows what revision and
author last modified each line of a file. Let&rsquo;s see what were the latest changes
made to this file:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git blame activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb</code></pre></div><p>Whoa! Although we get the last change of every line in the file, we are more
interested in the specific method (lines 176 to 189). Let&rsquo;s add a flag to
the <code>git blame</code> command, that will show the blame of just those lines. Also, we
will add the <code>-s</code> (suppress) option to the command, to skip the author names and
the timestamp of the revision (commit) that changed the line:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git blame -L 176,189 -s activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb

by <a href=https://twitter.com/schneems>Schneems</a> that made a very interesting
performance optimization by using frozen strings, which makes sense in our
current context. But, since we are on this hypothetical debugging session, this

our method under investigation gone through?</p><h2 id=searching-the-logs>Searching the logs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#searching-the-logs>#</a></h2><p>Now, we are back to the <code>git</code> log. The question is, how can we see all the
revisions that the <code>classify</code> method went under?</p><p>The <code>git log</code> command is quite powerful, because it has a rich list of options
to apply to it. We can try to see what the <code>git</code> log has stored for this file,
using the <code>-p</code> options, which means show me the patch for this entry in the
<code>git</code> log:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git log -p activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb</code></pre></div><p>This will show us a big list of revisions, for every revision of this file. But,
just like before, we are interested in the specific file lines. Let&rsquo;s modify the
command a bit, to show us what we need:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git log -L 176,189:activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb</code></pre></div><p>The <code>git log</code> command accepts the <code>-L</code> option, which takes the lines range and
the filename as arguments. The format might be a bit weird for you, but it
translates to:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git log -L &lt;start-line&gt;,&lt;end-line&gt;:&lt;path-to-file&gt;</code></pre></div><p>When we run this command, we can see the list of revisions for these lines,
which will lead us to the first revision that created the method:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>commit 51xd6bb829c418c5fbf75de1dfbb177233b1b154

+    end</code></pre></div><p>Now, look at that - it&rsquo;s a commit from 2011. Practically, <code>git</code> allows us to
travel back in time. This is a very good example of why a proper commit message
is paramount to regain context, because from the commit message we cannot
really regain context of how this method came to be. But, on the flip side, you
should <strong>never ever</strong> get frustrated about it, because you are looking at
someone that basically gives away his time and energy for free, doing open
source work.</p><p>Coming back from that tangent, we are not sure how the initial implementation
of the <code>classify</code> method came to be, given that the first commit is just a
refactor. Now, if you are thinking something within the lines of &ldquo;but maybe,
just maybe, the method was not on the line range 176 to 189, and we should look
more broadly in the file&rdquo;, you are very correct. The revision that we saw said
&ldquo;Refactor&rdquo; in it&rsquo;s commit message, which means that the method was actually
there, but after that refactor it started to exist on that line range.</p><p>So, how can we confirm this? Well, believe it or not, <code>git</code> comes to the rescue
again. The <code>git log</code> command accepts the <code>-S</code> option, which looks for the code
change (additions or deletions) for the specified string as an argument to the
command. This means that, if we call <code>git log -S classify</code>, we can see all of
the commits that changed a line that contains that string.</p><p>If you call this command in the Rails repo, you will first see <code>git</code> slowing
down a bit. But, when you realise that <code>git</code> actually parses all of the
revisions in the repo to match the string, it&rsquo;s actually super fast. Again, the
power of <code>git</code> at your fingertips. So, to find the first version of the
<code>classify</code> method, we can run:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git log -S <span style=color:#2aa198>&#39;def classify&#39;</span></code></pre></div><p>This will return all of the revisions where this method has been introduced or
changed. If you were following along, the last commit in the log that you will
see is:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-ruby data-lang=ruby>commit db045dbbf60b53dbe013ef25554fd013baf88134

DHH! This means that <code>classify</code> has been around since the beginning of (Rails)
time.
