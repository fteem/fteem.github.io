				<p>If you come from an object-oriented background, you might have tried
concurrency in your favourite OO language before. Your mileage will vary, but
in general OO languages are harder to work with when it comes to concurrency.
This is due to their nature - they are designed to keep state in memory and
require more expertise and experience to be successful with.</p>
<p>How does Elixir stand up to other languages when it comes to concurrency? Well,
for starters just being functional and immutable is a big win - no state to
manage. But also, Elixir has more goodies packing under the hood and in its
standard library.</p>
<p>Being based on Erlang's virtual machine (a.k.a. the BEAM), Elixir uses
processes to run <strong>any and all code</strong>. Note that from here on any time we
mention processes, unless specified otherwise, we are referring to BEAM
processes, not OS processes.</p>
<p>Elixir's processes are isolated from one another, they do not share any memory
and run concurrently. They are very lightweight and the BEAM is capable of
running many thousands of them at the same time. That's why Elixir exposes
primitives for creating processes, communicating between them and various
modules on process management.</p>
<p>Let's see how we can create processes and send messages between them.</p>
<h2 id="creating-processes">Creating processes</h2>
<p>One of the simplest (yet powerful) tools in Elixir's toolbelt is <code>IEx</code> -
Elixir's REPL, short for Interactive Elixir. If we jump into <code>IEx</code> and run <code>h self</code>, we will get the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; h self

                      def self<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>

  @spec self<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span> :: pid<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>

Returns the PID <span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>process identifier<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span> of the calling process.

Allowed in guard clauses. Inlined by the compiler.</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>self()</code> is a built-in function in Elixir which returns the PID
(process identifier) of the calling process. If you run it in <code>IEx</code> it will
return the PID of <code>IEx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; self
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.102.0&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, just like <code>IEx</code> is a BEAM process, with its own PID, it can also create
new processes. In fact, <em>any BEAM process</em> can <code>spawn</code> BEAM processes. This is
done using the <code>Kernel.spawn/1</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>3<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; spawn<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>fn -&gt; <span style="color:#099">1</span> + <span style="color:#099">1</span> end<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.108.0&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>spawn/1</code> creates a new process which invokes the function provided as
argument, <code>fn -&gt; 1 + 1 end</code>. What you might notice is that we do not see the
return value of the anonymous function because the function ran in a different
process. What we get instead is the PID of the spawned process.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noticing is that once we <code>spawn</code> a process it will run
right away, which means that the function will be immediately executed. We can
check that using the <code>Process.alive?/1</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>4<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> spawn<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>fn -&gt; <span style="color:#099">1</span> + <span style="color:#099">1</span> end<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.110.0&gt;</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>5<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; Process.alive?<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>pid<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>
false</code></pre></div>
<p>While we don't need to look at the <code>Process</code> module in depth right now, it has
quite a bit more functions available for working with processes. You can explore
its documentation <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at receiving messages.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-messages-in-processes">Receiving messages in processes</h2>
<p>For the purpose of our example, let's imagine we open a new <code>IEx</code> session and
we tell the <code>IEx</code> process (a.k.a. <code>self</code>) that it might receive a message that
it should react to. If this makes you scratch your head a bit, remember that
since <code>IEx</code> is a BEAM process it can receive messages just like any other BEAM
process.</p>
<p>The messages that we would like our <code>IEx</code> process to receive will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>tuple containing <code>:hello</code> atom and a string with a name (e.g. <code>{:hello, &quot;Jane&quot;}</code>)</li>
<li>tuple containing the <code>:bye</code> atom and a string with a name (e.g. <code>{:bye, &quot;John&quot;}</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the process receives the message in the first case it should reply with
&ldquo;Hello Jane&rdquo;, while in the second case it should reply with &ldquo;Bye John&rdquo;. If we
could use the <code>cond</code> macro in Elixir, it would look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">cond message do
  {<span style="color:#b84">:hello</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Hello </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
  {<span style="color:#b84">:bye</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Bye </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
end</code></pre></div>
<p>To receive messages in a process we cannot use <code>cond</code>, but Elixir provides us
with a function <code>receive/1</code> which takes a block as an argument. Although it's
not <code>cond</code>, it looks very similar to the example above because it lets us use
pattern-matching:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">receive <span style="font-weight:bold">do</span>
  <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, name<span style="font-weight:bold">}</span> -&gt; <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Hello #{name}&#34;</span>
  <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:bye, name<span style="font-weight:bold">}</span> -&gt; <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Bye #{name}&#34;</span>
end</code></pre></div>
<p>What you're seeing here usage of BEAM's actor model for concurrency in Elixir.
If you're not familiar with the model worry not - you can read an interesting
ELI5 about it <a href="https://dev.to/amalrik/explain-actor-concurrency-model">here on
Dev.to</a>, or you can
just keep on reading and by the end of this article you should have a good idea
about it.</p>
<p>The <code>receive</code> function takes the received message and tries to pattern-match it
to one of the statements in the block. Obviously, it accepts not just a value
to return but also a function call. As you can imagine, <code>receive/1</code> is what is
called when <strong>the mailbox of the process</strong> gets a new message in.</p>
<p>Now that we fixed up the actions on the mailbox of our process, how can we send
a message to our <code>IEx</code> process?</p>
<p>This is done via the <code>send/2</code> function. The function takes the PID and the
message itself as arguments. For our example, let's send the following message
to our <code>IEx</code> process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send self<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;John&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;John&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What you see here is the message being dropped in <code>IEx</code>'s mailbox. This means
that we need to invoke the <code>receive</code> function in our <code>IEx</code> session so we
can process the messages in the mailbox:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; receive <span style="font-weight:bold">do</span>
...<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, name<span style="font-weight:bold">}</span> -&gt; <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Hello #{name}&#34;</span>
...<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:bye, name<span style="font-weight:bold">}</span> -&gt; <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Bye #{name}&#34;</span>
...<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; end
<span style="color:#b84">&#34;Hello John&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right after executing the <code>receive</code> block the message will be immediately
processed and we will see <code>&quot;Hello John&quot;</code> returned.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-we-never-receive-a-message">What if we never receive a message?</h3>
<p>One thing to notice here is that if we would just write the <code>receive</code> block in
our <code>IEx</code> session it would block until the process receives a message.  That's
expected - if there is no message in the mailbox matching any of the patterns,
the current process will wait until a matching message arrives. This is the
default behaviour of <code>receive/1</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if we get ourselves stuck in such way we can always stop the <code>IEx</code>
session by using <code>Ctrl+C</code>. But, what if a process in our application gets
stuck?  How can we tell it that it should stop waiting after a certain amount
of time if it does not receive a message?</p>
<p>One nicety that Elixir provides us with is setting a timeout using <code>after</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">iex(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> receive do
...(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> {<span style="color:#b84">:hello</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Hello </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
...(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> {<span style="color:#b84">:bye</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Bye </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
...(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> after
...(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#099">1_000</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Nothing after 1s</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
...(<span style="color:#099">6</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> end
<span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Nothing after 1s</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What happens here is that the timeout function is executed after 1000
milliseconds pass and the <code>receive/1</code> function exits (hence stops blocking).
This prevents processes hanging around waiting forever for a matching message
to arrive in their mailboxes.</p>
<h2 id="long-running-processes">Long-running processes</h2>
<p>So far we were looking at sending and receiving messages to the same process -
the <code>IEx</code> process itself. This is quite a simple example and won't help when we
would like to put processes into action in a production application.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering how to actually spawn a process that
would react to multiple incoming messages, instead of just (ab)using the <code>IEx</code>
process with the <code>receive/1</code> function.</p>
<p>Well, to do this we have to make a process run infinitely (or until we ask it
to die). How? By creating an infinite loop in the process itself.</p>
<h3 id="wtf-you-mean-by-an-infinite-loop">WTF you mean by &ldquo;an infinite loop&rdquo;?!</h3>
<p>Yeah, I know, it feels weird, doesn't it? Here's the thing - the BEAM has an
optimisation in it, so-called a last-call optimisation (read Joe Armstrong's
explanation of this optimisation
<a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2016-October/090663.html">here</a>),
where if the last call in a function is a call to the same function, Elixir
will not allocate a new stack frame on the call stack. In fact, it will just
jump to the beginning of the same function (instead of running another instance
of it), which will prevent a stack overflow happening to our program.</p>
<p>This means that it's <em>virtually</em> impossible to smash the stack in the BEAM
languages (Erlang &amp; Elixir), if we are just a bit careful when composing these
self-invoking functions.</p>
<h3 id="long-running-processes-continued">Long-running processes, continued</h3>
<p>Let's look at a small module with a single function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">MyProcess</span> do
  def start do
    receive do
      {<span style="color:#b84">:hello</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">IO</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>puts <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Hello </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">!</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
        start()
      {<span style="color:#b84">:bye</span>, name} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">IO</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>puts <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Bye </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>name<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">. Shutdown in 3, 2, 1...</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>MyProcess.start</code> function when run will wait for a message to arrive in
the process&rsquo; mailbox. Then, it will try to pattern match on the arrived message
and execute the associated code. One trick is that at the end of the first case
we execute the <code>start</code> function again, which will create an infinite loop in
the process, therefore having the process waiting for messages forever.</p>
<p>Let's look how this will work in <code>IEx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> spawn<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>MyProcess, :start, <span style="font-weight:bold">[</span><span style="font-weight:bold">]</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.120.0&gt;</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Ilija&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
Hello Ilija!
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Ilija&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>3<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Jane&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
Hello Jane!
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:hello, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Jane&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>4<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:bye, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Jane&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
Bye Jane. Shutdown in 3, 2, 1...
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:bye, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Jane&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>First, we use <code>spawn/3</code> to create a process that will run the <code>MyProcess.run</code>
function. <code>spawn/3</code> is a flavour of <code>spawn/1</code> - the only difference is that
<code>spawn/3</code> knows how to run a named function in a process, while <code>spawn/1</code> takes
only anonymous functions as arguments.</p>
<p>Then, you can see that every time we send a <code>{:hello, &quot;Name&quot;}</code> message to the
process (using <code>send/2</code>), we see the process printing back the greeting. Once
we send the <code>{:bye, &quot;Jane&quot;}</code> message the process prints that it's shutting
down.</p>
<p>How so? Well, if you look at the <code>MyProcess.start</code> function you will notice
that it does not invoke itself after it prints out the shutdown message. This
means that once it handles that message the <code>MyProcess.start</code> function will
finish and the process will die.</p>
<p>Let's test that in <code>IEx</code>, using the <code>Process.alive?/1</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">iex(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> pid <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> spawn <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">MyProcess</span>, <span style="color:#b84">:start</span>, []

<p>Now that we know how to send and receive multiple messages to a process in
Elixir, you might be wondering what is a good use-case to use processes for?</p>
<p>The answer is: keeping state.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-state-using-processes">Keeping state using processes</h2>
<p>You might find this weird, but this is a classic example to keeping state
in Elixir. While our example here will not take care of storing state on disk,
cover all edge-cases that might occur or be a bullet-proof solution, I hope it
will get your brain juices flowing on processes and how to use them.</p>
<p>Let's write a <code>Store</code> module that will have a <code>start</code> function. It should spawn
a process which will invoke a function of the same module, for now,
called <code>foo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># store.exs</span>
defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:foo</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def foo(map) do
    <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">IO</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>puts <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Nothing so far</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's briefly dissect the <code>Store.start</code> function: what it does is it <code>spawn</code>s a
new process calling the <code>foo/1</code> function and it passes an empty map (<code>%{}</code>) as an
argument to the function. If the special keyword <code>__MODULE__</code> throws you off,
it's just an alias to the module name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">iex(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Test</span> do
...(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> def eql?, <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: __MODULE__ <span style="font-weight:bold">==</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Test</span>
...(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> end

iex(<span style="color:#099">2</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Test</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>eql?
true</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that when we call <code>Store.start</code> we will immediately see the output of
the function in the process. Right after, the process will die:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>4<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> Store.start
Nothing so far...
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.117.0&gt;</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>5<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; Process.alive? pid
false</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that we need to make <code>foo/1</code> a function that will loop forever. Or at
least until we tell it to stop.</p>
<p>Let's rename <code>foo/1</code> to <code>loop/1</code> and make it loop forever:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:loop</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def loop(state) do
    receive do
      loop(state)
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>If we run this module now in an <code>IEx</code> session the process will work forever.
Instead of doing that, let's add a special &ldquo;system&rdquo; message that we can send to
the process so we can force it to shut down:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:loop</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def loop(state) do
    receive do
      {<span style="color:#b84">:stop</span>, caller_pid} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller_pid, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Shutting down</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
      _ <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        loop(state)
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>So now, you see that when there's no match, the <code>Store.loop/1</code> function will
just recurse, but when the <code>:stop</code> message is received it will just <code>send</code> a
<code>&quot;Shutting down&quot;</code> message to the calling PID.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> Store.start
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.125.0&gt;</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:stop, self<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:stop, <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.102.0&gt;}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>3<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; flush<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>
<span style="color:#b84">&#34;Shutting down.&#34;</span>
:ok</code></pre></div>
<p>What you're seeing here is a very simple example of sending messages between
two processes - the <code>Store</code> process and our <code>IEx</code> session process. When we send
the <code>:stop</code> message we also send the PID of the <code>IEx</code> session (<code>self</code>), which
is then used by <code>Store.loop/1</code> to send the reply back. At the end, instead of
writing a whole <code>receive</code> block for the <code>IEx</code> session we just invoke <code>flush</code>,
which flushes the <code>IEx</code> process mailbox and returns all of the messages in the
mailbox at that time.</p>
<p>If you're feeling deep in the rabbit hole now worry not - we are going to
address keeping state in a process right away!</p>
<p>Let's say that our <code>Store</code> will accept four commands:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>stop</code> - the one we already implemented, which stops the <code>Store</code> process</li>
<li><code>put</code> - adds a new key-value pair to the <code>state</code> map</li>
<li><code>get</code> - fetches a value for a given key from the <code>state</code> map</li>
<li><code>get_all</code> - fetches all of the key-value pairs that are stored in the <code>state</code>
map</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="putting-a-value">Putting a value</h3>
<p>Let's implement the <code>put</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:loop</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def loop(state) do
    receive do
      {<span style="color:#b84">:put</span>, key, value} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        new_state <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Map</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>put(state, key, value)
        loop(new_state)
      {<span style="color:#b84">:stop</span>, caller} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Shutting down.</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
      _ <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        loop(state)
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>When we send a tuple containing <code>{:put, :foo, :bar}</code> to the process, it will
add the <code>:foo =&gt; :bar</code> pair to the <code>state</code> map. The key here is that it will
invoke <code>State.loop/1</code> again with the updated state (<code>new_state</code>). This will make
sure that the key-value pair we added will be included in the new state on the
next recursion of the function.</p>
<h3 id="getting-values">Getting values</h3>
<p>Let's implement <code>get</code> so we can test <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> together via an <code>IEx</code>
session:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:loop</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def loop(state) do
    receive do
      {<span style="color:#b84">:stop</span>, caller} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Shutting down.</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
      {<span style="color:#b84">:put</span>, key, value} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        new_state <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Map</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>put(state, key, value)
        loop(new_state)
      {<span style="color:#b84">:get</span>, key, caller} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Map</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>fetch(state, key)
        loop(state)
      _ <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        loop(state)
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Just like with the other commands, there's no magic around <code>get</code>. We use
<code>Map.fetch/2</code> to get the value for the key passed. Also, we take the PID of
the <code>caller</code> so we can send back to the caller the value found in the map:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> Store.start
<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.119.0&gt;</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>2<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:put, :name, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Ilija&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:put, :name, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Ilija&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:get, :name, <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.102.0&gt;}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>4<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; flush
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:ok, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Ilija&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
:ok

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>5<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:put, :surname, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Eftimov&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:put, :surname, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Eftimov&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>6<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; send pid, <span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:get, :surname, self<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="font-weight:bold">)</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:get, :surname, <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">#PID&lt;0.102.0&gt;}</span>

iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>7<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; flush
<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:ok, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Eftimov&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>
:ok</code></pre></div>
<p>If we look at the &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; we have with the <code>Store</code> process, at the
beginning, we set a <code>:name</code> key with the value <code>&quot;Ilija&quot;</code> and we retrieve it
after (and we see the reply using <code>flush</code>). Then we do the same exercise by
adding a new key to the map in the <code>Store</code>, this time <code>:surname</code> with the value
<code>&quot;Eftimov&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; perspective, the key piece here is us sending <code>self()</code> -
the PID of our current process (the <code>IEx</code> session) - so the <code>Store</code> process knows
where to send the reply to.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-dump-of-the-store">Getting a dump of the store</h3>
<p>Right before we started writing the <code>Store</code> module we mentioned that we will
also implement a <code>get_all</code> command, which will return all of the contents of the
<code>Store</code>. Let's do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Store</span> do
  def start do
    spawn(__MODULE__, <span style="color:#b84">:loop</span>, [%{}])
  end

  def loop(state) do
    receive do
      {<span style="color:#b84">:stop</span>, caller} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">Shutting down.</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>
      {<span style="color:#b84">:put</span>, key, value} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        new_state <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Map</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>put(state, key, value)
        loop(new_state)
      {<span style="color:#b84">:get</span>, key, caller} <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Map</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>fetch(state, key)
        loop(state)
      {<span style="color:#b84">:get_all</span>, caller } <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        send caller, state
        loop(state)
      _ <span style="font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span>
        loop(state)
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>If you expected something special here, I am very sorry to disappoint you. The
implementation of the <code>get_all</code> command is to return the whole <code>state</code> map of
the process to the sender.</p>
<p>Let's test it out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">iex<span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>1<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span>&gt; <span style="color:#008080">pid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> Store.start

<span style="font-weight:bold">{</span>:put, :name, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Jane&#34;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">}</span>

:ok</code></pre></div>
<p>As expected, once we add two key-value pairs to the <code>Store</code>, when we invoke the
<code>get_all</code> command the <code>Store</code> process sends back the whole <code>state</code> map.</p>
<p>While this is a very small and contrived example, the skeleton we followed here
by keeping state by using recursion, sending commands and replies back and
forth to the calling process is actually used quite a bit in Erlang and Elixir.</p>
<h2 id="a-small-disappointment">A small disappointment</h2>
<p>First, I am quite happy you managed to get to the end of this article.  I
believe that once I understood the basics of the concurrency model of Elixir,
by going through these exercises were eye-opening for me, and I hope they were
for you as well.</p>
<p>Understanding how to use processes by sending and receiving messages is
paramount knowledge that you can use going forward on your Elixir journey.</p>
<p>Now, as promised - a small disappointment.</p>
<p>For more than 90% of the cases when you want to write concurrent code in
Elixir, you will <strong>not</strong> use processes like here. In fact, you won't (almost)
ever use the <code>send/2</code> and <code>receive/1</code> functions. Seriously.</p>
<p>Why? Well, that's because Elixir comes with this thingy called OTP, that will
help you do much cooler things with concurrency, without writing any of this
low-level process management code. Of course, this should not stop you from
employing processes when you feel that you strongly need them, or when you want
to experiment and learn.</p>
