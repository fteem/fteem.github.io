				<p>The web, as we all know, is driven by APIs. Since the rise of mobile
applications and the JavaScript driven single-page applications, APIs became
even more popular, as a unified way for the clients to communicate with the
back-end. Most of the companies use internal APIs for different purposes. Some
use them to expose resources, data or behaviour. Others, use them for
authentication and authorisation, some do it for controlling the hardware layer
with smart implementations under the hood. Overall, APIs are enablers that
allow various clients to utilise the same back-end logic.</p>
<p>As we all know, banging some endpoints out of your head on the fly is rather
easy. Maybe that approach will cut it for your internal API. Most probably not,
but you could find your way around it. But, what if you wanted to expose a
public API for your product, just like Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and a load of
other companies do?</p>
<h3 id="the-design-process">The design process</h3>
<p>APIs need consistent and stable design. That means that, once an API is
released and clients start using it, breaking changes are a no-go. Even if you
want to provide backwards compatibility for (otherwise a breaking) change, it
will be a big hassle to pull off.</p>
<p>That means when building APIs we need to think about proper design. Yes, way
before we put any code in, we have to think about various things. I am sure
some of you find this obvious, but is it <em>that</em> obvious? And even then, how can
we actually do it?</p>
<p>An API design means that we need to take various steps to achieve a well though
out design before we have any code in place. We need to think about versioning,
headers, response format, caching. We need to think about filtering, sorting
and pagination of resources. Returning useful meta information, using
appropriate HTTP verbs, security, authentication and what not. Since an API has
so many moving parts, just putting some endpoints in place without putting (a
lot of) thought into them will not do the trick.</p>
<p>Oh, and what about REST?</p>
<h3 id="thinking-about-rest">Thinking about REST</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> as a
concept is a really neat way to represent state and resources, while having a
very intuitive design. REST means that your API has to be separated in logical
resources. These resources then can be manipulated via HTTP requests, by using
the appropriate methods. You know, whether a request uses the GET or the POST
HTTP method has <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html">a big
difference</a>, for a
good reason.</p>
<p>All of these things put together mean that designing an API has to be taken
very seriously and writing documentation and/or blueprints is a very nice step
towards a great API design.</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-blueprint">Writing a blueprint</h2>
<p>If you got so far, I assume that you agree with my point. So, how can we improve
our workflow?</p>
<p>Well, although I often get the &ldquo;hack-n-slash&rdquo; urge, I believe that APIs have to
be done with a design-first approach. You can compare it to tests in
test-driven development.</p>
<p>Every API has to have a contract before it is developed. This is where tools
like <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> come in handy. API Blueprint is
a way (or syntax) to define and design APIs in a standardised manner. This
means that by writing a special flavour of markdown, a team (or teams) of
developers can collaborate to design APIs to the best of their knowledge.</p>
<p>Blueprints allow developers to define metadata, resource groups, resources,
actions and so on. You can define requests and responses in various formats
(like XML and JSON), specify request and response headers.</p>
<p>Let's see an small example of an API blueprint.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">FORMAT: 1A

<span style="color:#999"># Polls
</span><span style="color:#999"></span>
Polls is a simple web service that allows consumers to view polls and vote in them.

<span style="color:#999"># Polls API Root [/]
</span><span style="color:#999"></span>
This resource does not have any attributes. Instead it offers the initial API affordances in the form of links in the JSON body.

It is recommended to follow the “url” link values or Link headers to get to resources instead of constructing your own URLs to keep your client decoupled from implementation details.

<span style="color:#aaa">## Retrieve the Entry Point [GET]

<span style="color:#aaa">## Group Question
</span><span style="color:#aaa"></span>
Resource related to questions in the API.

<span style="color:#aaa">## Question [/questions/{question_id}]

                    ]
                }</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can notice, the API blueprint starts with the format and the host where
the API is located. Then, it describes resource groups, like <code>Polls</code>, and
endpoints like <code>Polls API Root [/]</code>. Then, every endpoint is described by
providing the appropriate HTTP verb, with the description and the request and
response body.</p>
<h3 id="wheres-the-value">Where's the value?</h3>
<p>By having a blueprint of an endpoint, we create a contract to which our API has
to oblige. This is very useful, since we provide ground rules and high-level
overview of our API, but still we have technical and design decisions easily
visible.</p>
<p>Think about this case - there's an API that for some endpoints has to provide
metadata. Great, nothing out of the ordinary. A valid question is, what will
the metadata look like? Usually, metadata contains a cursor, or in other words,
pagination data like <code>page</code>, <code>per_page</code>, or <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code>. Almost always
it contains the <code>total</code> number of objects that the API contains of the
requested resource. Often, it contains the attribute that we order by and the
ordering direction. In JSON, that would looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;meta&#34;</span>: {
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;limit&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#099">10</span>,
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;offset&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#099">20</span>,
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;order_by&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#b84">&#34;id&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;order_dir&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#b84">&#34;desc&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;total&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#099">200</span>
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>But, will this be useful? Sure it will, but are we missing any data here? Maybe
you would like to provide the locale as part of the metadata? By leaving these
questions unanswered, you are immediately adding &ldquo;design debt&rdquo; to your API.
This means that, if a client needs the locale, you will have to change the
contract of the API itself, for <strong>all</strong> endpoints.</p>
<p>By taking a step back while designing the API, we can describe our metadata in
a blueprint. This allows us to see in advance how our API responses will look
like and we can have a meaningful discussion with our colleagues about it. That
is why, these sort of decisions have to be documented. Imagine changing the
metadata structure on a live API, for example, removing or changing the name of
an attribute of the metadata - most (if not all) clients that use it will
break.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-an-api">Exploring an API</h2>
<p>Another very important side-effect of using an API blueprint is explorability.
To discover an API means that you can test and use the endpoints via a tool or
your browser. It means that the consumer can see the data coming in and out of
the API.</p>
<p>To do this, the consumer will have to know the location, the endpoints, the
data format, parameters, headers and whatnot. Simply said, the consumer needs a
detailed API documentation.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Even if we have our endpoints thought out, we have to remember that if we are
building a REST API we need to think about resources. &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;, you might think,
&ldquo;we will replicate the database model in our API&rdquo;. Are you sure you want and
(more importantly) need this?</p>
<p>Although REST APIs expose resources, APIs also expose behaviour. You have to
ask yourself &ldquo;what behaviour I want to give to the consumers&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are the
resources that this behaviour will expose&rdquo;. To do this, API blueprint has a
very neat tool called MSON. MSON is an acronym for &ldquo;Markdown Syntax for Object
Notation&rdquo; and it is a way to represent data structures in markdown.</p>
<p>While we describe our API endpoints in a blueprint, we also need to describe
the data objects that will be returned. For example, if we have a <code>Product</code>
object we can describe it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="color:#999"># Product
</span><span style="color:#999"></span>A product from Acme&#39;s catalog

<span style="color:#aaa">## Properties
</span><span style="color:#aaa"></span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">-</span> id: 1 (number, required) - The unique identifier for a product
<span style="font-weight:bold">-</span> name: A green door (string, required) - Name of the product
<span style="font-weight:bold">-</span> price: 12.50 (number, required)
- tags: home, green (array[string])</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, it is quite trivial to write and to read. A <code>Product</code> has a
description and properties. The properties is a list of items, with a name,
type, presence and a description. By looking at this MSON file, we can see that
our JSON representation of this object will look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#099">1</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#b84">&#34;A green door&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;price&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#099">12.50</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;tags&#34;</span>: [ <span style="color:#b84">&#34;home&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;green&#34;</span> ]
}</code></pre></div>
<p>By knowing what our endpoints return and what these objects look, we can easily
explore our API. There is less friction and no &ldquo;guess work&rdquo; - you just know what
to call and what the call will return.</p>
<p>If you would like to read more about MSON, I recommend checking their
<a href="https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/tutorial.html">short tutorial</a>. It
demostrates more cool features, like inheritance, nesting and so on.</p>
<h3 id="everyday-exploring">Everyday exploring</h3>
<p>This is what an API blueprint can provide. You can take your API blueprint file
and <a href="https://github.com/pixelfusion/blueman">convert it to a Postman collection</a>.
You can in fact use the awesome <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>
tool and convert it to any format you want.</p>
<p>For example, let's imagine we have the following API Blueprint ready for one of
our APIs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">FORMAT: 1A

## Account [/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}]

Exposes the `Account` resource.

### Fetch Account [GET]

    + account_id (number) - ID of the Account in the form of an integer

    {
      &#34;id&#34;: 123,

    }</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> has the ability to import Swagger
JSON, you can get the actual endpoint in your Postman and you can immediately
fire requests away. Here is how my actual Postman looks like after importing the
JSON above:</p>
<p><img src="/postman-api-blueprint.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, you can use full blown explorers like <a href="apiary.io">Apiary</a> that
will put your blueprint on steroids. It will provide various examples on how to
send requests to the API, with a mock server, live editor and documentation
style page. You can see the API blueprint from above on Apiary
<a href="http://docs.apibexample.apiary.io/#">here</a>.</p>
<p>Last but very important, you can use tools like
<a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> to
<strong>dynamically generate an API client</strong> by feeding it your Swagger Resource
Declaration (the JSON file from above).</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/tools.html">all of the tools</a> that API
Blueprint has currently available and how you can fit it into your workflow.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty of design questions that we as developers have
to answer. Sure, we take pride and have passion for what we do, but often we
resort to hacking some endpoints before thinking about them. But if we document
and design our APIs before we start building them, we will sleep better knowing
that our clients will function well. And as enablers, a non-functioning client
means a broken API. Or a broken design.</p>
<p>Also, the vast choice of tools that work with API Blueprints can completely
change the way you build your APIs (and their clients). You can even generate
real code out of the API Blueprint, by converting it to Swagger JSON first. All
of this seems unreal, but once you get it in your workflow you can immediately
feel the benefits. I mean, who doesn't like documentations on steroids, request
examples, mock servers for free, automatic generation of API clients and so on?</p>
<p>Or, you can just bang out those couple of endpoints you need. The choice is
yours.</p>
