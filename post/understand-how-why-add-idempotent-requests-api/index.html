				<p>Idempotency is an often used term in computer science. It's meaning to some
might not be known, to others it's very well known. The explanation for
idempotency on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Wikipedia</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science that
they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the
initial application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, idempotency is the mathematical way of saying &ldquo;one can apply a
certain operation on something many times, without changing the result of the
operation after the first time the operation is applied&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A common example of this would be an <code>UPDATE</code> statement in SQL. For example,
imagine you have a SQL table full of student's first and last names, like in a
school system. Updating a name of a student, would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="font-weight:bold">UPDATE</span> students <span style="font-weight:bold">SET</span> first_name <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span><span style="color:#b84">John</span><span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">WHERE</span> id <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#099">123</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>Applying this query is idempotent, because the first time you run it it will
update the name of student with id <code>123</code>, but if you run it a milion times more
after, the result will not change - the name will still stay <code>John</code>.</p>
<p>Let's think a bit about APIs now. Imagine you have an API to do bank
transactions, what would happen if in the middle of a API call for performing a
transaction the server throws an exception and the call fails? What if the
client crashes and it never receives the message? Or, what if the connection
drops mid-way and the client never gets the response of the server, but the
server executes the transaction?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there can be many causes of an API call failing, but how
would we know if the operation failed or it succeeded? How would we known if a
transaction went through, or not?</p>
<p>Imagine if our APIs were smart enough so we could selectively make calls to the
API idempotent?</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-at-hand">The problem at hand</h2>
<p>I work in Catawiki, where we do auctions. For those not familiar with auctions
- auctions are group of items (called lots) that people can bid on during a
period of time. Bidding is the process of offering up a price for an item,
within the aforementioned time period.</p>
<p>If you are reminded of early eBay days, that's perfect. Knowing about how eBay
used to work back in the day is enough knowledge about auctions you need for
this blog post.</p>
<p>So people come to the website, they browse through the various auctions
running, they view the items they would like to own and they bid on them. As
you can imagine, placing a bid on an item is the most important action in an
auction site and the user must know when their bid has been accepted (or not).
So, what would happen if the request dies in mid-flight? Or maybe our user's
browser gets stuck, and the user tries to click multiple times on the bid
button while the browser sits unresponsive.</p>
<p>How can we know if the actual bid was placed or not?</p>
<h2 id="idempotent-apis">Idempotent APIs</h2>
<p>When we are dealing with similar systems, one of the way one could tackle this
problem is designing APIs that have the ability to be idempotent. Since we
already established what idempotency means, idempotent APIs are APIs where any
write operations can have effect only once for a given set of parameters.</p>
<p>In fact, some companies have already implemented solutions for this, and one of
the better examples out there is <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency">Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>Stripe's API does that via a HTTP header, called <code>Idempotency-Key</code>, which is a
random set of characters. An example cURL request looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -H <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Idempotency-Key: AGJ6FJMkGQIpHUTX&#34;</span> <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -d <span style="color:#008080">amount</span><span style="font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#099">2000</span> <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -d <span style="color:#008080">currency</span><span style="font-weight:bold">=</span>usd <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -d <span style="color:#008080">description</span><span style="font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;Charge for Brandur&#34;</span> <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -d <span style="color:#008080">customer</span><span style="font-weight:bold">=</span>cus_A8Z5MHwQS7jUmZ</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can imagine, just like with bidding, designing APIs whose consumers can
do actual money transactions are quite important to be very safe from various
failures, especially where the sending or the receiving party cannot process
the request/response fully.</p>
<p>So, how could we design and implement an idempotent API solution for our
auctions website? Let's start off by some wishful thinking.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl https://api.example.com/v1/item/:item_id/bid <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -X POST <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -H <span style="color:#b84">&#34;X-Auth-Token: BGT9FJMkd1Ow&#34;</span> <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -H <span style="color:#b84">&#34;Idempotency-Key: AGJ6FJMkGQIpHUTX&#34;</span> <span style="color:#b84">\
</span><span style="color:#b84"></span>       -d <span style="color:#008080">amount</span><span style="font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#099">2000</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our API would have an endpoint, called <code>POST /v1/item/:item_id/bid</code>, which
would create a bid for our item on auction. The request, in it's payload, would
contain the amount for the bid, and in the headers it would contain the API
token and the idempotency key.</p>
<p>Simple enough for a first iteration of our solution, but complicated just
enough to do the trick for us.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-endpoint">Adding the endpoint</h2>
<p>In our simple example auction application, we'll have the following models (and
respective associations):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Auction</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#008080">ApplicationRecord</span>

  has_many <span style="color:#b84">:bids</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Personally, I am used to using <a href="https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape">Grape</a> on
a daily basis to build REST APIs with, so the syntax you will be seeing here
will be from Grape. But the general approach and solution can be transfered to
other frameworks and languages.</p>
<p>Our endpoint would look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="font-weight:bold">module</span> <span style="color:#555">API</span>

              <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
              desc <span style="color:#b84">&#39;Create a bid for a lot&#39;</span>

                body <span style="font-weight:bold">false</span>
              <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
            <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can notice, this is a very simple endpoint. It's URI is <code>POST /lots/:lot_id/bids</code>, and in the request body it accepts the amount of the bid
as an integer. If you would like to see how the endpoint performs, you can
fetch the <a href="https://github/fteem/auctionz">repo</a>, set it up locally and play
with it.</p>
<p>The first step to adding idempotency token support is to be able to easily send
it. If you are using a API browser like Postman or Paw, you have that ability
out of the box. These API browsers allow us to send any type of params or
headers. For example, this is what a successful request to this endpoint looks
like, via Postman:</p>
<p><img src="/idempotency-key-bids-successful-request.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can notice, we explicitly set the endpoint to return no body which will
set the HTTP status to 204, therefore providing enough context if and when the
bid is accepted by the system.</p>
<p>The internals of the endpoint are quite simple - we find the lot by the
<code>lot_id</code> from the URI, and we create a <code>Bid</code> for it with the <code>amount</code> sent in
the <code>params</code>. No magic, very simple endpoint.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, when bidding for an item on auction, every bid has to be
bigger than the previous one. Therefore, adding a validation on the <code>Bid</code> model
to do these kind of checks is required. This is what our <code>Bid</code> model will look
like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Bid</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#008080">ApplicationRecord</span>
  belongs_to <span style="color:#b84">:lot</span>

  validates <span style="color:#b84">:amount</span>, <span style="color:#b84">presence</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold">true</span>, <span style="color:#b84">numericality</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold">true</span>
  validate <span style="color:#b84">:amount_larger_than_previous_bid</span>

  <span style="font-weight:bold">private</span>

  <span style="font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold"></span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span><span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">amount_larger_than_previous_bid</span>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">return</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">true</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">if</span> lot<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>bids<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>none?
    <span style="font-weight:bold">return</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">true</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">if</span> amount <span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> lot<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>bids<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>last<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>amount

    errors<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>add(<span style="color:#b84">:amount</span>, <span style="color:#b84">&#39;must to be larger than previous bid&#39;</span>)
  <span style="font-weight:bold">end</span>
en</code></pre></div>
<p>In the model, the <code>Bid#amount_larger_than_previous_bid</code> method will do this
check for us, and add the appropriate errors to the amount attribute, if
needed.  If we try to send another bid to the same lot from before, this is
what we will get back:</p>
<p><img src="/idempotency-key-bids-unsuccessful-request.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-key">Introducing the key</h2>
<p>Adding the key to the header, from the perspective of the client, is a very
simple feat. Postman, just like any standard HTTP library, allows us to set the
headers to our requests. For example, in Postman that would look like:</p>
<p><img src="/idempotency-key-header-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This will apply the <code>Idempotency-Key</code> header to the request, for our API to
pick up and validate. So, how would our API accomplish this?</p>
<p>In cases like this one, I personally prefer opaque approaches, meaning, an
approach that the stack can work with without any additional hassle to the
daily work of the developers of the APIs. One of those approaches is by adding
a middleware that will take care of logging the idempotency keys and returning
the saved responses.</p>
<p>But, before we jump in to the middleware, we have to think of how we can store
the headers that will be used, and the responses that will be coupled to each
of these idempotency headers.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest solution that we could work with is using our database.
I already feel some of you frowning at this and saying &ldquo;WTF is wrong with this
guy?!&quot;. I agree, this is not even near optimal, but bear with me for the sake
of the example. Let's introduce a tiny <code>IdempotentAction</code> model, which will
have <code>idempotency_key</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>headers</code> and <code>status</code> attributes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">IdempotentAction</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#008080">ApplicationRecord</span>
  validate_presence_of <span style="color:#b84">:idempotency_key</span>, <span style="color:#b84">:body</span>, <span style="color:#b84">:status</span>, <span style="color:#b84">:headers</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will do it for now. This model can store all of the idempotency keys that
have been sent to the API, together with the body, status and headers of the
response. Now, back to the middleware.</p>
<p>We want whenever a client of our APIs sends a request using a <code>Idempotency-Key</code>
header to check if that key has been used (and return the saved response if so)
or save a new entry to our table with idempotent requests and respond with the
response of the API.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at skeleton of this middleware:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># lib/idempotent_request.rb</span>

<p>If the header is present in the request, we will query the database for and
check if there's a <code>IdempotentAction</code> entry present. If it is, the middleware
will stop any futher execution in the middleware stack (a.k.a. the rest of the
application) and will immediatelly respond with the saved <code>body</code>, <code>status</code> and
<code>headers</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will make sure it proceeds with the chain of execution, and after
all of the request is fulfilled it will store the <code>body</code>, <code>status</code> and
<code>headers</code> in a <code>IdempontentAction</code> entry in the database. By doing that any
subsequent request using the same <code>Idempotency-Key</code> header will result in the
previous response, regardless of the body, URI or params of the request.</p>
<p>Mounting this middleware is as easy as adding this line to the application's
<code>config/application.rb</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="font-weight:bold">module</span> <span style="color:#555">MyApp</span>

<p>Now, if we send a request to our endpoint to create a bid for a lot, with an
<code>Idempotency-Key</code> header, in our server logs we will see something like:</p>

<p>As you can tell, the middleware kicks in, picks up the header value and checks
for a possible entry in the <code>IdempotentAction</code> model. Then, it proceeds with the
exectuion of the request, and afterwards it persists the response with the
key in the table. Any subsequent request with the same <code>Idempotency-Key</code> will
produce a log like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Started POST &#34;/lots/99/bids&#34; for 127.0.0.1 at 2017-10-28 01:22:09 +0200

<p>That's it! The middleware will pick up the record from the database and it will
send the response immediatelly.</p>
<p>Although the idempotent requests mechanism is interesting, keeping all of these
keys can be expensive, especially if you do it in an nonoptimal way like by
using the database. Whenever you are in doubt if data like this should be
stored in a database, always think about how crucial to your business this data
is.  For the scope of our example, this data is not business critical,
therefore we could offload it to a different type of storage.</p>
<p>What would be a cheap way of storing these idempotency keys?</p>
<h2 id="swapping-the-storage">Swapping the storage</h2>
<p>A very cheap way of persisting these keys is, believe it or not, by putting
them (programatically) in a file. Ruby as a language provides couple of
key-value store solutions, like <code>PStore</code> and <code>YAML::Store</code>. I personally prefer
<a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML/Store.html"><code>YAML::Store</code></a>
because it would allow us to read the contents of the file it writes to, unlike
<code>PStore</code> which writes the files in binary format.</p>
<p>If you've never used <code>YAML::Store</code>, think of it as a streamlined approach to
writing/reading to a file using YAML. Let's briefly open an <code>irb</code> session and
play a little bit with <code>YAML::Store</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&gt;&gt; require &#39;yaml/store&#39;
=&gt; true

# Open a new store
&gt;&gt; store = YAML::Store.new(&#39;file_to_write_in.yml&#39;)
=&gt; #&lt;Psych::Store:0x007fbf83d3e0d8 @opt={}, @filename=&#34;file_to_write_in.yml&#34;, @abort=false, @ultra_safe=false, @thread_safe={}, @lock=#&lt;Thread::Mutex:0x007fbf83d3de30&gt;&gt;

# Write something to the store
&gt;&gt; store.transaction { store[&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;Ilija Eftimov&#39; }
=&gt; &#34;Ilija Eftimov&#34;

# Read something from the store
&gt;&gt; store.transaction(false) { store[&#39;name&#39;] }
=&gt; &#34;Ilija Eftimov&#34;</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, if we check our file where our store is writing to, we will see something
like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">---<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb"></span>name:<span style="color:#bbb"> </span>Ilija<span style="color:#bbb"> </span>Eftimov</code></pre></div>
<p><code>YAML</code> is super flexible and will know how to marshall different type of objects
into YAML. Also, when you want to read from the store, it will unmarshall them
back and create objects with their properties.</p>
<p>After that quick crash course in <code>YAML::Store</code>, let's get back to our middlware.
This is what it would look like, if we use <code>YAML::Store</code> as a storage engine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#999">require</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#39;yaml/store&#39;</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Compared to our database solution, the <code>YAML::Store</code> solution is a bit simpler,
and more lightweight. As you can notice, the approach is the same - we check if
our store already has the idempotency key persisted, and if so we return the
saved <code>status</code>, <code>headers</code> and <code>response</code>. Otherwise, we let the middleware chain
finish executing, and then we persist the idempotency key with the response data
to the store.</p>
<p>As with any other solution, this approach has couple of pros and cons. As you
can imagine, saving this data to a file is not really reliable. Backing up the
file, although it seems simple, it can be quite error prone compared to the
already provided solutions to backing up databases. Also the more traffic our
service gets, the disk I/O would increase quite a bit, therefore the solution
would not scale too far into the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this solution has no dependency on a database, nor on Active
Record. It does have a dependency on <code>YAML::Store</code>, but that one is much cheaper
to load to your application because it doesn't have other dependencies that it
needs to run (except <code>YAML</code>, which is already loaded by default in your Rails
apps). From a code perspective, it's very simple - it feels like saving to a
hash that automatically gets dumped onto disk. It requires no additional models,
schemas or migrations.</p>
<h2 id="expiring-the-keys">Expiring the keys</h2>
<p>Whenever we store this type of data, a good idea is to clean up the used keys
after a certain period of time, because the responses that they have stored are
already stale and unusable for the clients. Therefore, cleaning this from a
relational database or a YAML file will require custom solution, for example, in
the form of a scheduled job that would scrape off all the stale keys. Or maybe
in another way, still by adding more and more code to our codebase that we would
need to maintain.</p>
<p>Or, we could change our storage, again?</p>
<p>When it comes to storing keys with values the most popular choice (with a good
reason!) is Redis. It is riddiculously fast in what it does, writing and reading
to it with Ruby is very simple, and it even provides a TTL (Time To Live) which
means it will automatically expire our stale keys without us writing a single
line of code. Of course, Redis provides much more, but for the purpose of this
article, it seems to fit just like a glove.</p>
<p>Note: If you are unfamiliar with Redis, I would recommend giving a shot at their
<a href="http://try.redis.io/">interactive course</a> to get yourself faimilar with the
basics of Redis.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-to-redis">Connecting to Redis</h3>
<p>To communicate with Redis via a Rails app, we need to add the <code>redis</code> gem to our
bundle. After installing the gem via <code>bundle install</code>, we can immediatelly
connect to our local Redis instance without any special configurations. If you
are following this tutorial, but haven't installed Redis yet, you can go over
to their <a href="https://redis.io/download">download page</a> and install it from there.</p>
<p>If you are running OSX, you can install it via Homebrew by installing the
<a href="http://formulae.brew.sh/formula/redis">redis</a> formula.</p>
<p>Having Redis running locally, and the redis gem in our app's bundle, we can
proceed to update our middleware to work with Redis.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-and-storing-the-data">Organizing and storing the data</h3>
<p>We can store our keys in
a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro">hash structure</a>, where the key will
be the idempotency key, and the value in the hash will be a serialized hash that
will contain the <code>status</code>, <code>headers</code> and <code>body</code> of the response. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># Key : Serialied Hash
&#34;1753ae4677&#34;: &#34;{\&#34;status\&#34;:204,\&#34;headers\&#34;:{},\&#34;response\&#34;:[\&#34;\&#34;]}&#34;
&#34;d3894c01c0&#34;: &#34;{\&#34;status\&#34;:422,\&#34;headers\&#34;:{\&#34;Content-Type\&#34;:\&#34;text/plain\&#34;,\&#34;Content-Length\&#34;:\&#34;85\&#34;},\&#34;response\&#34;:[\&#34;{\\\&#34;status\\\&#34;:422,\\\&#34;error\\\&#34;:\\\&#34;Validation failed: Amount has to be larger then previous bid\\\&#34;}\&#34;]}&#34;</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both the key and the value are strings, where the value is the
JSON serialized hash of the data we need. If you are wondering why JSON - it's
because serializing is very fast (with <a href="https://github.com/ohler55/oj">Oj</a>) and
it's (somewhat) readable when it's serialized therefore easy to access in Redis
and explore/debug.</p>
<p>Let's modify our middleware to work with Redis:</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you've been reading the code so far in our previous solutions, the approach
is literally the same, only the way we store and read the data changes, from
both storage and code perspective. This time, we use <code>Oj.dump</code> to serialize and
<code>Oj.load</code> to deserialize our object to/from JSON. Also, storing the data is done
by calling the <code>redis</code> client, namely the
<a href="https://redis.io/commands/hmset"><code>hmset</code></a> and
<a href="https://redis.io/commands/hget"><code>hget</code></a> methods.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">redis<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>hget <span style="color:#008080">REDIS_NAMESPACE</span>, key</code></pre></div>
<p><code>hget</code> will execute a <code>HGET</code> command in Redis, which will get the hash that
is stored under the <code>REDIS_NAMESPACE</code> value (in our case <code>idempotency_keys</code>),
and will access the key with the value of <code>key</code>. If present, this will retrieve
the serialized JSON object, or <code>nil</code> if not present.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">redis<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>hmset <span style="color:#008080">REDIS_NAMESPACE</span>, key1, payload1, key2, payload2</code></pre></div>
<p><code>hmset</code> will execute a <code>HMSET</code> command in Redis, which will set a new key in the
hash, where the key will be the value of <code>key1</code>, and the value will be the hash
that <code>payload1</code> is assigned to. The same key - value pair arguments scheme
continues for the rest of the arguments.</p>
<h3 id="ttl">TTL</h3>
<p>One of the great features of Redis are called &ldquo;Redis expires&rdquo;. What that means
is that basically you can set a timeout for a key, which is a limited time to
live (TTL). When the time to live elapses, the key is automatically destroyed.</p>
<p>So, how can we leverage Redis expires to our advantage? Well, the first question
that would pop up in my mind is for how long do we want to keep these
keys/responses in our database? Ideally, the answer to this question is: short.
Although this mechanism of saving the data can be very useful, if the data is
not expired after a certiain period of time, you are looking at an unneeded
complexity from data warehousing, security and scaling pespective. Also, most of
the data that will not be expired will be stale, because it will be relevant
until the client understands that the idempotent request has been fulfilled and
will move on with it's operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, adding a TTL on the key is not a silver bullet, but for most of the
cases it's a very good idea. Let's see how we can update our middleware to
set the correct TTL on the Redis keys:</p>

<p>Let me save you from the trouble of reading the code and finding the
differences - we added only the <code>redis.expire</code> expire call after setting the
value of the key in the <code>set</code> method. The <code>expire</code> method takes two arguments -
the first one is the key and the second one is the expiry time (in seconds).
Our code will set these keys to expire after 24 hours from the time of setting
them, therefore allowing enough time for the requests to be registered as
completed by the clients.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are implementing a mechanism for idempotent requests for your
APIs, the expiration time should be set to your liking, because the data should
have a retention period that makes sense for the problem you are
solving/facing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although our final solution is not very far from our previous
ones, whether it's using a relational databse or a storage in file, Redis
allows us to more easily scale the solution while keeping itself clean from
stale data.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Having all of this in mind, it's clear to see that idempotent requests can be a
useful addition to an API, especially where the nature of the API requires such
behaviour. For example, Stripe have idempotent requests for <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">their
API</a> , because they are working with payments and
this sort of mechanism can be useful for clients to not accidentally replay a
charge of a card because of a network issue. Also, in our example, idempotent
requests can be useful because you don't want the client to try to set the same
bid twice, due to the nature of an auction (very time sensitive).</p>
<p>In this post we also saw three type of solutions that could work for a
mechanism like this one, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>using a relational database;</li>
<li>using a <code>YAML::Store</code>; and</li>
<li>using Redis</li>
</ol>
<p>We also briefly discussed what kind of challenges each of these approaches
bring, and we also took a stab at implementing the idempotent requests
mechanism using a Rails middleware.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the actual code of this Rails app, and the middleware
we built, you can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/fteem/auctionz">sample repo on
Github</a>, fetch the code and play with it
yourself.</p>
