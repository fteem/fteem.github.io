				<p>Reactive Programming is a relatively new and interesting programming paradigm
that has picked up quite a bit of popularity lately. Out of curiosity, I did a
bit of research over the weekend. In this blog post I will summarize what I
learned and try to explain what RP to any novice out there. Also, I show you
how to use the Reactive Extensions for Ruby. Let's dive in!</p>
<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>
<p>I rarely have strong opinions, but I really think that to understand anything
in life, you need to understand the motivation behind it. In this case, to
understand what Reactive Programming is, we need to see what problems it is
solving.</p>
<p>All of the programming paradigms that we know of at this point of time are
invented more than 20 years ago. Yes, even functional programming. In fact, it
was invented like 60 years ago. The problem is, just like with anything that
evolves, priorities change.</p>
<p>In our case, the internet happened. Sure, +20 years ago the internet did exist,
but it had less users then the count of views that a popular video on YouTube
has today. Going forward 15-10 years ago, the internet grew enough, so we felt
the need for a ton of data processing and asynchronous behaviour.</p>
<p>Applications needs have changed, from poll-based to full reactive applications,
where the data is pushed to us. Each time, we're adding more complexity, more
data, and asynchronous behavior to our applications. So, reactive programming
is a way to manage all of that complexity, mindset switch included.</p>
<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
<p>The word invented might hurt someone's ears. At the low level, the paradigm is
basically a construct of two design patterns that have been around for more
then 20 years. Actually, one of the most popular design patterns book, the Gang
of Four book, covers these two design patterns: the Iterable and the <code>Observer</code>
patterns. These two patterns are behavioral design patterns, which characterize
the interaction and responsibility of objects and classes.</p>
<h3 id="iterator">Iterator</h3>
<p>Taken from the GoF book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key idea in this pattern (the Iterator) is to take the responsibility for
access and traversal out of the list object and put it into an iterator object.
The Iterator class defines an interface for accessing the list's elements. An
iterator object is responsible for keeping track of the current element; that
is, it knows which elements have been traversed already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds familiar? I am sure it does. Ruby's <code>Enumerable</code> module does just that,
it returns an enumerator, which encapsulates the data and the traversal
methods.  Okay, let's keep this short then - an iterator in Ruby is an instance
of a class that includes the <code>Enumerable</code> module. Which, it's pretty much any
collection.</p>
<h3 id="observer">Observer</h3>
<p>The observer pattern is a design pattern in which an object, called the
subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies
them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their
methods. Usually, it's used to implement distributed event handling systems.</p>
<p>Basically, the subjects are the objects that send the messages to the objects
that observe the subjects (damn!). The subjects push the messages to the
observers, which is why this is called the Observer Pattern.</p>
<p>Ruby ships with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html">Observable
module</a>
in it's standard library, which provides a simple mechanism for one object
(subject) to inform a set of subscribers (observers) of any state change.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-programming">Reactive Programming</h2>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of both, the Iterator and the Observer
patterns, it's time for the Reactive Programming paradigm.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a>,
Reactive Systems are: Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven. I
don't know about you, but these type of definitions confuse me a lot. In the
way that I understand the Reactive Manifesto, Reactive Systems are
asynchronous, fault tolerant, scalable and they communicate with non-blocking
message-passing.</p>
<p>But, what interests us is the implementation, especially in Ruby. Would you be
surprised if I tell you that on the surface, the reactive programming paradigm
is basically an abstraction on top of the the <code>Observer</code> pattern in combination
with the <code>Iterator</code> pattern?</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Let's see a few examples.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-extensions">Reactive Extensions</h2>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxRuby/blob/master/readme.md">README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reactive Extensions for Ruby (or, RxRuby) is a set of libraries to compose
asynchronous and event-based programs using observable collections and
Enumerable module style composition in Ruby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, told ya? <code>RxRuby</code> is a library, which does all of the abstractions for
us, so we can easily start with Reactive Programming in Ruby. Neat, eh?</p>
<h3 id="observables">Observables</h3>
<p>Let's see how <code>RxRuby</code> works, in it's simplest form.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#008080">RxRuby</span><span style="font-weight:bold">::</span><span style="color:#008080">Observable</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>just(<span style="color:#099">42</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>RxRuby::Observable</code> is just a stream. A stream is a subject (or, an object)
that you can subscribe to (or, observe). Now, the <code>RxRuby:Observable</code> module
itself doesn't do anything, unless we invoke a method on it. Let's carry on
with the example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">stream <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#008080">RxRuby</span><span style="font-weight:bold">::</span><span style="color:#008080">Observable</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>just(<span style="color:#099">42</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span>)
stream<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>subscribe {<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span>num<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span> <span style="color:#999">puts</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">We received: </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>num<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>What do you think will happen here? Let's break it down. The object that we
receive is a just the number 42, wrapped as an observable. Since the observable
implements (most of) the <code>Enumerable</code> methods, we can do anything with it. But,
to avoid any complication in this example, we will just <code>subscribe</code> to the
observable and pass in a lambda. The lambda will be invoked on everytime the
stream pushes any data (or, in this case, just once).</p>
<p>The output of the example will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">We received 42.</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="observing-on-an-array">Observing on an array</h3>
<p>Now, since we have a lot of the methods from the <code>Enumerable</code> mixin available,
let's do something with an array. There's two ways of working with arrays in
<code>RxRuby</code>: via ranges and via plain arrays.</p>
<p>Via ranges:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#008080">RxRuby</span><span style="font-weight:bold">::</span><span style="color:#008080">Observable</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>range(<span style="color:#099">1</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span>,<span style="color:#099">10</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span>)
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>select {<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span>num<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span> num<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>even? }
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>sum
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>subscribe {<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span>s<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span> <span style="color:#999">puts</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">The sum of the even numbers from 1 to 10 is: </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>s<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>This will return:
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">The sum of the even numbers from <span style="color:#099">1</span> to <span style="color:#099">10</span> is: <span style="color:#099">30</span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>Let's break it down. First, we create an observable range, with the numbers
from 1 to 10. Then, we invoke <code>select</code> on the observable, with a lambda as a
parameter.  The lambda takes each number of the range as a parameter, and
filters all even numbers from the observable, returning a new observable. Then,
we invoke <code>sum</code> on it, which sums all of the even numbers.</p>
<p>At the end, we <code>subscribe</code> on the observable that <code>sum</code> returns. By subscribing
we basically &ldquo;watch over&rdquo; the observable (or, the stream of data) and invoke
the lambda that we pass as an argument to the <code>subscribe</code>. Any time the
observable pushes any data, it will go through this &ldquo;funnel&rdquo; and invoke the
last lambda at the end, which will print out the message.  the observables push
any data we</p>
<p>Doing this via arrays is very similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">arr <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#999">Array</span>(<span style="color:#099">1</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span><span style="font-weight:bold">..</span><span style="color:#099">10</span><span style="font-weight:bold"></span>)
<span style="color:#008080">RxRuby</span><span style="font-weight:bold">::</span><span style="color:#008080">Observable</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>from_array(arr)
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>select {<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span>num<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span> num<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>even? }
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>sum
  <span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>subscribe {<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span>s<span style="font-weight:bold">|</span> <span style="color:#999">puts</span> <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">The sum of the even numbers from 1 to 10 is: </span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>s<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>This snippet will also return the same message at the end. The only difference
here is that we create an observable from an array.</p>
<h2 id="more-rxruby">More RxRuby</h2>
<p>The documentation on RxRuby is still scarce, but fortunately for us there are a
lot of <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxRuby/tree/master/examples">examples</a> in
the Github repo.</p>
<p>Also, I have ported the <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJSKoans">RxJS
Koans</a> to Ruby, for easier
learning of the library.  <a href="https://github.com/fteem/rxrubykoans">RxRuby Koans</a>
is still a bit unstable, but it should give you a nice overview RxRuby's
methods/objects.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>I am not sure what the future holds for RxRuby, but it seems that reactive
programming is here to stay. Netflix has built quite a big architecture built
on the Reactive Systems paradigm. Also, the Reactive JavaScript community is
<strong>super vibrant</strong>, unlike the Ruby community. But, let's hope for the best!</p>
<p>As for me - I am looking for anyone that's proficient with RxRuby, to review my
RxRuby Koans, so we can get it moving somewhere.</p>
