				<p>There has always been a lot of noise about Test-Driven Development (TDD), best
practices and it's pros and cons. I don't know if you remember, but last year
DHH, Kent Beck and Martin Fowler had a series of public hangouts where they
shared their opinions on TDD and testing in general and engaged in a very
interesting discussion. These hangouts were recorded and in my opnion - they
are a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9quxZsLcfo">must watch</a>.</p>
<p>But, this blog post won't be about TDD itself. Disclaimer: I really like TDD.
Very often it's joy to practice TDD. Sometimes it's very challenging, but in my
opinion, challenge means growth.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>We, software developers, very often rely on our experience. Which is good. I am
not saying using your experience and prior knowledge is bad. No. On the
contrary, it's good. What I find amusing is that we think that similar problems
can be solved with the same solution. For example, in the past we have worked
on a problem where adding a caching layer to the application sped up the
application which solved the problem. What we often do is we would recognize a
similar problem in our current work and we think that using a caching layer
would do the trick. And very often, we are wrong. And we smash our head in a
wall.</p>
<p>I've found myself into the same position when practicing TDD. In the beginning</p>
<ul>
<li>even way too often.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tdd-jihad-1">The TDD jihad <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Quote often, when I practice TDD, I find myself in a position where I don't
know what I should do next. What I am saying is - I am basically stuck. And I
have indentified various reasons for this. But almost always, the main reason
is: lack of domain knowledge. It's like, you stumble into a part of the app you
are building and you don't have a slightest idea of what direction you should
go next. And very often I think about how I can circumvent this.</p>
<p>So what I do in this situation? Well, usually I get overwhelmed and I need a
break. I get up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I sit down, take a sip of
the coffee and read what I've done until then. I am pretty sure we've all been
in this situation, more or less.</p>
<p>What I always realize is that I am over-focusing on making those tests pass.
One would argue that this is the whole point of TDD. But I'd say no!</p>
<h2 id="test-driven-thinking">Test-driven thinking</h2>
<p>While we are writing those failing tests and then adding the implementation
code (that will make the tests green) we are missing a very interesting thing -
those tests are talking to us. Our test suites contain lots of knowledge about
the domain model. We are writing various tests cases which can later be used as
specification detail for the system itself (hence the name &lsquo;specs&rsquo;). By adding
all of that knowledge about the domain into our test suite we are locking that
knowledge and tying it do the application, so the tests are basically a bio of
the domain.</p>
<p>I have colleagues that when they start working on software, they always start
with the tests. It's not about the TDD cycle. Actually, it's about all of that
knowledge that can be found in the code's test. The tests (if well written) can
tell a lot about the class and it's implementation. And they immediately get
the point of that piece of code and it's purpose. Now, that's what I'd call
test-driven thinking. You know your destination (the final needed functionality
of the code), you let the tests talk to you, you think about to where you've
come to and where you need to be heading.</p>
<p>Instead of lurking around with no idea where to go next - you must have the end
goal in mind &amp; you must read what you've already implemented. And the tests
will show you the end of the tunnel!</p>
<p>Material Exploration And what about when you get parachuted in a legacy project
that deperately needs an upgrade and you literally haveno clue what to do? I've
been into this position and believe me, it sux!</p>
<p>Well, take small steps! If you take small steps, you iterate and eventually
you'll get to the perfect functionality of your code. Easier said than done? Of
course. It's software development! :-)</p>
<p>Not having a clue is OK. No, really, it is. No one knows everything. But the
key here is to take smalls steps. This means that while you work you can mess
with the code. And by code I mean the tests. Don't touch the implementation
until you are confident. If there's a part of the app that does not have tests
- write them! By doing that you'll explore the domain, the code, the
implementation and, most importantly, you learn. The domain model will sinks
into your head, you'll start to understand it and eventually you'll be in a
good position to start refactoring. That is called material exploration. You
learn from your work while you work.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>So, yeah, whenever you get stuck - don't worry. Just take small steps and don't
rush. Read the existing tests, add more, then add some more and build up your
confidence about the code. After a while, you'll be very confident about making
changes and adding new functionality.</p>
