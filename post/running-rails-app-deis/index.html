				<p>In the last couple of years, we have seen a lot of development in the devops
field. It’s becoming much easier for developers to provision servers and deploy
their applications on those servers just with a couple of key strokes. Since
the start of the SaaS and PaaS products (even before we knew them as that), we
have seen a vast number of companies and communities try to make our lives
easier by developing smart tools that will fit into our workflow seamlessly.</p>
<p>As a side effect, or perhaps intentionally, we’ve also seen the open-source
community create tools to not just make the workflow easier but to cut costs
and enable us to make great software without thinking about the costs of the
hardware.</p>
<p>Amazon with its huge selection of web services (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>)
and the like have made our lives much easier when it comes to incorporating
infrastructure and tools in the cloud. Then there are
<a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">Chef</a> and <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> that
made provisioning servers a breeze. Then came containerization in the form of
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, although some would argue that containers,
or at least the idea around them, existed well before Docker came along.</p>
