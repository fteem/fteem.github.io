				<p>Unless you've been living under a rock for the last couple of years, you
probably know what two-factor authentication (2FA) is. It's quite a neat trick
actually - you have a password that you have to (obviously) enter correctly
(first factor), but you also have to receive a second (random) code through a
different medium, sometimes on a different device, that you have to enter to
log in (second factor).</p>
<p>Now, obviously this adds quite a bit of overhead to logging in, but it adds a
disproportionate value when it comes to security. If you work in any sort of
organisation it was probably no surprise when you were asked to turn on 2FA for
all your accounts. If you haven't been asked to (or haven't done it), it's time
to act ;)</p>
<p>But, what about factor No. 1? The password. Did we give up on them?</p>
<p>Not really. But, for sure we had to become more vigilant and smarter when
setting our passwords. Why? Allow me to explain.</p>
<h2 id="reader-meet-haveibeenpwnedcom">Reader, meet haveibeenpwned.com</h2>
<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned.com</a>.  It's
a free resource for anyone to quickly assess if they may have been put at risk
due to an online account of their's having been compromised or &ldquo;pwned&rdquo; in a
data breach. As you can imagine, to fulfil its purpose, this service also
contains quite a long list of pwned passwords (about 500 million of them to be
more precise), which are open for querying through a REST API.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the project, or it's
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">author</a>, I suggest checking
out the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/About">About</a> page of the project.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-pwned-passwords-api">Using the pwned passwords API</h2>
<p>This API allows us to check if any password is present in haveibeenpwned
database. This means that if you send an already pwned password it will tell
you that this password has been pwned and that it's suggested to choose another
one.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a website where people can set their passwords, and once the
user finished typing their new password you can ping this service and check if
the password they chose has been pwned before.</p>
<p>Now, if you are thinking along the lines of &ldquo;are you telling me to send a
plain-text password across the wire to some random API?&rdquo; then you're a step
ahead, well done!</p>
<p>Sorry to disappoint, but no, actually I am not saying that. Instead of sending
the whole password in plain-text, this API only requires the 5 characters of
the SHA-1 hash of the actual password.</p>
<p>In Elixir terms, that would look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span style="color:#b84">:crypto</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>hash(<span style="color:#b84">:sha</span>, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">password</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>)
<span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Base</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>encode16
<span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">String</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>slice(<span style="color:#099">0</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span><span style="color:#099">4</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Interestingly what it sends back is <em>the remainder of the hashed passwords</em>
that match the 5 characters that you sent. Basically, this means if we take a
SHA-1 of &ldquo;password&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">iex(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b84">:crypto</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>hash(<span style="color:#b84">:sha</span>, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">password</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>) <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Base</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>encode16
<span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">5BAA61E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We will send only <code>5BAA6</code> to the API, while in the response body we will
receive a big list of strings that will represent the rest of the SHA-1, or in
our example that would be <code>1E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8</code>.</p>
<p>Troy Hunt, who's the author of haveibeenpwned has written quite an extensive
explanation on how this works - you can read it
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pinging-the-api">Pinging the API</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this exercise, we will create a small Mix package that will
encapsulate all of the behaviours. If you're not familiar with how to create
new packages using Mix, I suggest reading my article <a href="/writing-elixir-library">Write and publish your
first Elixir library</a>.</p>
<p>We will call our package <code>Pwnex</code> because somehow my brain always thinks that I
have to mix up the main word (pwned) with Elixir to come up with a name.
Anyway, let's create it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">› mix new pwnex
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/pwnex.ex
* creating <span style="color:#999">test</span>
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/pwnex_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use <span style="color:#b84">&#34;mix&#34;</span> to compile it, <span style="color:#999">test</span> it, and more:

    <span style="color:#999">cd</span> pwnex
    mix <span style="color:#999">test</span>

Run <span style="color:#b84">&#34;mix help&#34;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">for</span> more commands.</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have the package bootstrapped locally, let's open <code>lib/pwnex.ex</code> and
add some documentation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Pwnex</span> do

  def pwned?(password) do
  end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>moduledoc</code> briefly explains the purpose of the package, while the <code>doc</code>
explains the purpose of the <code>pwned?/1</code> function and has two examples that we
could use in the doctests.</p>
<h2 id="our-little-algorithm">Our little algorithm</h2>
<p>Let's see what would be the steps to implement the <code>Pwnex.pwned?/1</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def pwned?(password) do
  {hash_head, hash_tail} <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span>
    password
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> sanitize
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> hash
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> split_password

  hash_head
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> fetch_pwns
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> handle_response
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> find_pwns(hash_tail)
    <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> return_result
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Once more - the pipeline operator in Elixir makes this function so clear and
procedure-like that explaining feels a tad redundant. Still, here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sanitize</code> - we want to remove all leading and trailing whitespaces from the
password</li>
<li><code>hash</code> - we want to convert the password to a SHA1 hash and return it's first
5 characters</li>
<li><code>split_password</code> - we want to split the head - first 5 characters that we
will send to the API and the tail - the rest of the SHA-1 hash</li>
<li><code>fetch_pwns</code> - we will send an API request to haveibeenpwned to get all (if
any) pwns of the password</li>
<li><code>handle_response</code> - depending on the response we will either get the body, or
the reason for failure returned</li>
<li><code>find_pwns</code> - we will take the response body, and because haveibeenpwned uses
a k-Anonymity model we will need to find the actual match ourselves (if
present)</li>
<li><code>return_result</code> - will return the tuple which will contain a result atom and
a pwns count</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a step by step approach and implement these functions.</p>
<h2 id="manipulating-the-password">Manipulating the password</h2>
<p>Let's start easy. In sanitize, we want to trim leading and trailing
whitespaces, while in <code>hash</code> we want to turn the password to SHA1 and return
it's first five characters.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def sanitize(password), <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">String</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>trim(password)</code></pre></div>
<p>There isn't much to explain here really. Instead of using <code>sanitize</code> we can use
<code>String.trim/1</code>, but I prefer to have a separate function that we could extend
and test for any edge cases.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defp hash(password) do
  <span style="color:#b84">:crypto</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>hash(<span style="color:#b84">:sha</span>, password)
  <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Base</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>encode16
end</code></pre></div>
<p><code>:crypto</code> is an <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/crypto.html">Erlang module</a> that
provides a set of cryptographic functions. Interestingly, it's not part of the
standard library, but it comes included in the distribution. One of the
functions, as you can see in the code above, is <code>hash/2</code>, which takes the
hashing algorithm as the first argument and the actual string to be hashed as
the second argument. It returns the binary hash, that we can convert to hex by
using <code>Base.encode16</code>.</p>
<h2 id="sending-request-to-an-api">Sending request to an API</h2>
<p>I bet you're thinking <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/httpoison">HTTPoison</a>. Aren't
you? While I was writing this article I was also wondering do we have to
include to a whole package just to do a simple GET request. You guessed it - we
do not.</p>
<p>Although Elixir does not ship an HTTP client, Erlang does. And just like with
<code>:crypto</code>, you can use Erlang's HTTP client from Elixir using <code>:httpc</code>. This
module provides the API to an HTTP/1.1 compatible client. I suggest giving
<a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/httpc.html">it's documentation</a> a quick scan before
we move on.</p>
<p>Let's let's open up IEx and give <code>:httpc</code> a spin:</p>

<p>You see, although the output is pretty verbose if you have ever sent an HTTP
request via cURL or you've opened your browser's debugging tools, there
shouldn't be any surprises here. The <code>request/1</code> function will send a request
to the pwnedpasswords API and it will return a ton of nested tuples, most of
them being the response headers and the raw body of the response.</p>
<p>For our purpose, we can keep it simple. We are only interested if the function
will return <code>:ok</code> atom as the first item in the tuple, or <code>:error</code>. We can use
pattern matching to do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">iex(<span style="color:#099">1</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold">&gt;</span> {<span style="color:#b84">:ok</span>, {_status, _headers, body }} <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span>
  <span style="color:#b84">:httpc</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>request(<span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span><span style="color:#b84">https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21FCB</span><span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>So, lets get back to our <code>Pwnex.fetch_pwns/1</code> function. The function will
receive the first 5 characters of the hashed password, it will send that to the
API and will return the <code>body</code> of the response:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def fetch_pwns(head) do
  <span style="color:#b84">:httpc</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>request(<span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span><span style="color:#b84">https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/</span><span style="color:#b84">#{</span>head<span style="color:#b84">}</span><span style="color:#b84">&#39;</span>)
end</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="handling-the-response">Handling the response</h2>
<p>The <code>handle_response</code> will actually be one function with three bodies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">  def handle_response({<span style="color:#b84">:ok</span>, {_status, _headers, body}}), <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: body
  def handle_response({<span style="color:#b84">:error</span>, {reason, _meta}}), <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: reason
  def handle_response(_), <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: nil</code></pre></div>
<p>By using pattern matching we can have three types of function bodies. The first
one will be invoked when the response status is HTTP 200 OK, the second one
when there's an error and the third one for any other case.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we could have used conditional logic here, but having the
power of pattern matching allows us to have three tiny functions that are very
easy to read, understand and test.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-the-response">Parsing the response</h2>
<p>Here's the body of the response:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">003D68EB55068C33ACE09247EE4C639306B:3\r\n012C192B2F16F82EA0EB9EF18D9D539B0DD:1\r\n01330C689E5D64F660D6947A93AD634EF8F:1\r\n0198748F3315F40B1A102BF18EEA0194CD9:1\r\n01F9033B3C00C65DBFD6D1DC4D22918F5E9:2\r\n0424DB98C7A0846D2C6C75E697092A0CC3E:5\r\n047F229A81EE2747253F9897DA38946E241:1\r\n04A37A676E312CC7C4D236C93FBD992AA3C:5\r\n04AE045B134BDC43043B216AEF66100EE00:2\r\n0502EA98ED7A1000D932B10F7707D37FFB4:5\r\n0539F86F519AACC7030B728CD47803E5B22:5\r\n054A0BD53E2BC83A87EFDC236E2D0498C08:3\r\n05AA835DC9423327DAEC1CBD38FA99B8834:1\r\n05E0182DEAE22D02F6ED35280BCAC370179:4</code></pre></div>
<p>If you look carefully you'll notice that it's actually a list of partial SHA-1
hashes separated by <code>\r\n</code>. With a closer inspection of the first one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">003D68EB55068C33ACE09247EE4C639306B:3</code></pre></div>
<p>you notice that it's actually a part of the hash, a colon <code>:</code> and a number (<code>3</code>
in the example above). This is actually the hash without it's first 5
characters and the number of times that particular password has been pwned.</p>
<p>This means that the password who's SHA-1 hash is
<code>5BAA6003D68EB55068C33ACE09247EE4C639306B</code> has been pwned 3 times, according to
haveibeenpwned.com.</p>
<p>What we need to with this response body is to split it, to convert it to a list
which we will iterate and find our matching hash in. Let's do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def find_pwns(response, hash_tail) do
  response
  <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> to_string
  <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">String</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>split()
  <span style="font-weight:bold">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">Enum</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>find(<span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;</span>(<span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">String</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>starts_with?(<span style="color:#800080">&amp;1</span>, hash_tail)))
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Although <code>find_pwns/2</code> might look a bit loaded, let me assure you it's not.
Let's see what each of the lines do here:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>to_string</code> will convert the character list we receive from <code>fetch_pwns</code> and
will convert it to a string so we can parse it in the next steps</li>
<li><code>String.split</code> will split the string on the <code>\r\n</code> characters and will
create a list of strings, looking like:
<code>[&quot;003D68EB55068C33ACE09247EE4C639306B:3&quot;, ...]</code></li>
<li>We will invoke <code>Enum.find</code> which takes the list and a function as arguments.
The list is the parsed list of hash tails and their pwns count, while the
function is <code>String.starts_with?/2</code>, which will return <code>true</code> when a line
starts with the value of <code>hash_tail</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all. At the end, the <code>find_pwns/2</code> function will return either the line
that contains the matched hash tail or it will return <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h2 id="returning-a-meaningful-result">Returning a meaningful result</h2>
<p>Now that we have found the count of pwns for the hash (or just a <code>nil</code>), we
need to handle that and return a meaningful tuple to the user of the module.</p>
<p>When the <code>find_pwns</code> function does find a count, we want to return a tuple like
<code>{:pwned, count}</code>. Otherwise, when <code>find_pwns</code> does not find a count it will
return <code>nil</code>, which we handle in the second definition of the <code>return_result</code>
function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def return_result(line) when is_binary(line) do
  [_, count] <span style="font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">String</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>split(line, <span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span><span style="color:#b84">:</span><span style="color:#b84">&#34;</span>)
  {<span style="color:#b84">:pwned</span>, count}
end

def return_result(_), <span style="color:#b84">do</span>: {<span style="color:#b84">:ok</span>, <span style="color:#099">0</span>}</code></pre></div>
<p>In the first function body we will take the <code>line</code>, which should be a binary
(string), split it at the <code>:</code> character and then return the tuple with the
count.  In the second function body we take any argument (which in our case is
<code>nil</code>) and return a tuple with <code>0</code> as the count.</p>
<h2 id="using-pwnex">Using Pwnex</h2>
<p>Now, let's load Pwnex in IEx and give it a spin. To load it in IEx, you need to
open the root of the module and run <code>iex -S mix</code>. This will open a IEx session
and execute <code>mix</code> in it, which will in fact, load and compile the module and
make it available for invocation directly from IEx:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">›</span> iex <span style="font-weight:bold">-</span><span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">S</span> mix

<p>As you can see, <code>password</code> has been pwned about 3.5 million times, while
<code>123!@#asd*&amp;(*123SAkjhda</code> never.</p>
<p>That's basically it. We have Pwnex working - it takes our input as a function
argument, talks to an API through an Erlang HTTP client, parses its response
body, builds a map of hashes and finds any pwns for the given password.</p>
<p>As you can see, this whole package does quite a bit in 65 lines of code.</p>
<p>In this article, we saw how we can create a new package, use it to communicate
with an API over HTTP, we learned why you don't always need HTTPoison, how you
can parse a request body and how you can mingle with some data.</p>
