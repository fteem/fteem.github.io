Thing #2: I am an expatriate. That basically means the country I call home is not the country I was born or grew up in.">

<p>Here are 3 quick things you probably don’t know about me:</p>
<p>Thing #1: I lived on three different continents. Yes, that means I had a place
to live, I had a job and had (some) social life.</p>
<p>Thing #2: I am an expatriate. That basically means the country I call home is
not the country I was born or grew up in. (Shoot me a message if you're
thinking about moving abroad – I'll help gladly.)</p>
<p>Thing #3: I am (trying to) post a single atomic idea in less than 250 words
every day over on my <a href="https://twitter.com/itsilija">Twitter account</a>. Join me!</p>
<p>I also have a newsletter. You can join here
<a href="https://ieftimov.ck.page/subscribe">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the day, I work for <a href="https://scribd.com">Scribd</a> as a senior software
engineer, busting bugs, building services, working with CDNs, while trying to
change the way the world reads.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch, you can find me on
<a href="https://twitter.com/itsilija">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fteem">Github</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieftimov">LinkedIn</a> or
<a href="email:blog@ieftimov.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
