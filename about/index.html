<p>Here are 3 quick things you probably don’t know about me:</p>
<p>Thing #1: I lived on three different continents. Yes, that means I had a place
to live, I had a job and had (some) social life.</p>
<p>Thing #2: I am an expatriate. That basically means the country I call home is
not the country I was born or grew up in. (Shoot me a message if you're
thinking about moving abroad – I'll help gladly.)</p>
<p>Thing #3: I'm on a mission to simplify the lives of people with a career in
software development, or to the ones that want to enter the field.</p>
<p>I also have a newsletter. If you
<a href="https://ieftimov.ck.page/subscribe">join</a>, twice a month you will
receive a new blog post designed to help you improve your software engineering
skills and career.</p>
<p>My experience? I work for <a href="https://scribd.com">Scribd</a> as a senior software
engineer, building services-oriented architectures while trying to change the
way the world reads.</p>
<p>Before that, I spent three and a half years in <a href="http://catawiki.com">Catawiki</a>
as an senior engineer and team lead and three years before that as a full-stack
Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="http://siyelo.com">Siyelo</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch, you can find me on
<a href="https://twitter.com/fteem">Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/fteem">Github</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieftimov">LinkedIn</a> or
<a href="email:blog@ieftimov.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
