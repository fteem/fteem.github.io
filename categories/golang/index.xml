          <description>Some of my newsletter subscribers have asked me a few times what is the easiest way to think about byte slices, or using Go&#39;s syntax: []byte. Folks that have experience with low-level languages, where working with bytes is widespread, usually do not have challenges comprehending what []byte means and how to use it.
But, if you come from a dynamic or a high-level language background, although everything we do ends up being a bunch of bytes, higher-level languages hide such details from us.</description>

          <description>This year&#39;s dotGo in Paris was awesome. The people were great in general. The organisers and volunteers did a good job. The attendees that I interacted with were cool – I had some interesting conversations and made couple of connections. The talks were informative and engaging. If this is where you stop reading, please give dotGo a shot next year - I am sure it will be great! And please find me in the crowd and talk to me, because I&#39;d love to talk to you.</description>
