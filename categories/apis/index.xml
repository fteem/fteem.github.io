          <description>Idempotency is an often used term in computer science. It&#39;s meaning to some might not be known, to others it&#39;s very well known. The explanation for idempotency on Wikipedia is:
 &amp;hellip; the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science that they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
 Essentially, idempotency is the mathematical way of saying &amp;ldquo;one can apply a certain operation on something many times, without changing the result of the operation after the first time the operation is applied&amp;rdquo;.</description>

          <description>The web, as we all know, is driven by APIs. Since the rise of mobile applications and the JavaScript driven single-page applications, APIs became even more popular, as a unified way for the clients to communicate with the back-end. Most of the companies use internal APIs for different purposes. Some use them to expose resources, data or behaviour. Others, use them for authentication and authorisation, some do it for controlling the hardware layer with smart implementations under the hood.</description>
