      <description>Unless you&#39;ve been living under a rock for the last couple of years, you probably know what two-factor authentication (2FA) is. It&#39;s quite a neat trick actually - you have a password that you have to (obviously) enter correctly (first factor), but you also have to receive a second (random) code through a different medium, sometimes on a different device, that you have to enter to log in (second factor).</description>

      <description>Ruby on Rails as a framework does a lot of things for us developers. We get a very customizable middleware stack, great routing system, very expressive ORM, helpful modules with great utility methods in them and so on. But in Rails there&#39;s more than meets the eye. It does some great things that we just take for granted or on occasions we don&#39;t even know they exist.
Some of these features are TLS redirection, secure cookies and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</description>
