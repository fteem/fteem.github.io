      <description>Mixins in Ruby are a very powerful feature. But knowing how to test them sometimes is not so obvious, especially to beginners. I think that this comes from mixins&amp;rsquo; nature - they get mixed into other classes. So, if you think that there is a lot to testing mixins and you easily get overwhelmed by it - take it easy, it&#39;s not that hard.
Let&#39;s see how easy it is to test mixins, with some help from the lovely Minitest.</description>
