It makes bringing up and tearing down different Docker containers easy with a single command. Especially if your application requires additional backing services, like a data store, a Docker Compose setup for local development makes it very easy to spin them all up in one go.
Another reason why I like Docker Compose because I am a bit of a purist when it comes to Dockerfiles – I believe that there should be only one Dockerfile for your service, and it should work for all environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
