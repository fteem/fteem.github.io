      <title>Testing in Go: Table-Driven Tests</title>
      <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-table-driven-tests/</link>

      <description>Coming from Ruby, which has excellent testing tools and libraries, the notion of table-driven tests was unusual for me. The popular testing libraries in Ruby, like RSpec, force the programmer to approach testing from a BDD standpoint. Thus, coming to Go and learning about the table-driven test was definitely a new way of looking at tests for me.
Looking back, Dave Cheney&amp;rsquo;s 2013 seminal blog post &amp;ldquo;Writing table driven-tests in Go&amp;rdquo; was very likely my gateway to table-driven tests.</description>

      <description>As I was going down the stairs I remember feeling the temperature dropping. It was an astounding experience descending towards the basement in my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house – it felt cooler and quieter. The light was warm and dimmed, with creepy shadows dropping behind the old furniture that was serving its last years before getting disposed to the city cleaning service.
One of the rooms in the basement was my grandfather’s workshop.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Crew, prepare for landing&amp;rdquo; echoed through the cabin. I looked out of the window and I saw the island – I was freaking out, but super excited at the same time. As a kid growing up in the Balkans, if you told me I would visit Bali one day I am sure I would not believe you for a second.
The first memory I have of walking in the hotel was the May heat and humidity.</description>

      <description>I remember it was summer and it the A/C was blasting in the office. My mentor and I were looking at one of the screens on my desk. It was the biggest screen I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on - a 24 inch 720p Dell. It meant a lot to me - I felt like a real programmer, whatever that means, looking at these vast areas of black screen and many split terminals, with tons of white characters on the black background.</description>

      <title>Testing in Go: Failing Tests</title>

      <description>In the previous article on testing in Golang, titled Testing in Go: First Principles, we looked at what testing looks like in Golang. In this article, we will do a deeper dive in the testing package. More specifically, we will take a look at the different ways we can fail tests in our test suites and when and how we should use these techniques.
Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look under the covers in the testing package.</description>

      <description>If you have any programming experience, whether that&amp;rsquo;s as a student or a professional, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you have heard about testing. It&amp;rsquo;s an omnipresent topic, be it on conferences, books or articles. (See what I did there?)
Also, it seems like a topic that everyone agrees on - yes, testing is good and we should do it. There are many reasons why folks consider testing good for you code.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive in the Upcoming Go Error Inspection Changes</title>

      <description>The team behind the language started working on a document titled &amp;ldquo;Go 2 Draft Designs&amp;rdquo;. The draft document is part of the design process for Go v2.0. In this article we will zoom in at the proposal for error inspection in Go 2.
What&amp;rsquo;s worth noting is that this is still part of a draft proposal. Still, from where we are standing at the moment, it&amp;rsquo;s certain that these changes will be added to the language starting Go v1.</description>

      <description>In this age of cloud platforms, Internet of Things and SaaS products that are easy to integrate with, the effort of automating parts of your life is shrinking down substantially with every year that goes by. Additionally, these services have very generous free plans (or are quite affordable), you won&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a fortune for this automation. In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can create your own commands for your Google Home.</description>

      <title>Barebones model of Spotify&#39;s &#39;Recently Played&#39; screen using a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache in Golang</title>

      <description>One of the most used caching schemes is Least Recently Used (LRU). Caches that use this eviction strategy will remove the least recently used item when their size reaches their capacity. That means that such caches have to keep a track of the order of access of the cached items, so it would evict the correct items.
Before we go too much into details about the implementation of an LRU cache, let&amp;rsquo;s first see what are the possible applications of this caching scheme.</description>

      <title>When and Why to use a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache with an implementation in Golang</title>

      <description>Over the years, people involved in computer science and engineering have worked really hard on optimisations of various natures. Given that we live in a world with limited resources, humanity has always worked on ways to optimise the costs and speed literally everything.
In software engineering, I would argue, the most popular approach to performance improvement is caching. While there are various applications of caching, depending on the area of software engineering, the idea behind caching is quite simple: store data that is often needed/used in fast structure/storage so it can be retrieved very fast.</description>

      <title>Golang Datastructures: Trees</title>

      <description>You can spend quite a bit of your programming career without working with trees, or just by simply avoiding them if you don’t understand them (which is what I had been doing for a while).
Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - arrays, lists, stacks and queues are quite powerful data structures and can take you pretty far, but there is a limit to their capabilities, how you can use them and how efficient that usage can be.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, we took a look at linked lists and how we can apply them in a hypothetical use-case. In this post, we will look at two similar but powerful data structures.
Modelling actions and history Think about Excel or Google docs. You know, the most ubiquitous applications for composing documents that humanity has invented. We&amp;rsquo;ve all used them in some capacity. As you might know, these apps come with various actions one can apply to a text.</description>

      <description>Data structures and algorithms are the bread and butter of computer science. Although sometimes they appear scary to people, most of them have a simple explanation. Also, when explained well with a problem algorithms can be interesting and fun to learn and apply.
This post is aimed at people that are not comfortable with linked lists, or folks that want to see and learn how to build one with Golang.</description>

      <description>If you have ever tried writing a daemon for MacOS you have met with launchd. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t have the experience, think of it as a framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and scripts. If you have any *nix experience the word daemon should not be too alien to you.
For those unfamiliar, a daemon is a program running in the background without requiring user input.</description>

      <title>Packing multiple binaries in a Golang package</title>
      <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/golang-package-multiple-binaries/</link>

      <description>Recently, while writing a small Golang program for setting reminders I came across a small confusion that I guess most newcomers to Golang will have - how to organise a package in a way that will enable it to cleanly contain two or more binaries.
This post is not aimed at experienced Golang programmers, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly aimed at beginners to understand how to compose more complex packages, beyond making the usual &amp;ldquo;one package one binary&amp;rdquo; ones.</description>
