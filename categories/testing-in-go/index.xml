          <title>Testing in Go: Test Doubles by Example</title>

          <description>One of the biggest misconceptions is that doubles are a specific implementation of mocks or other testing constructs that we use in testing.
Dummies, mocks, stubs, fakes, and spies ARE test doubles. Test double is the category of these test constructs. Over the years, there has been some confusion around this concept.
It is my observation that this confusion arises from the naming of testing constructs that the popular testing frameworks use.</description>

          <title>Testing in Go: Dependency Injection</title>
          <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-dependency-injection/</link>

          <description>In software engineering, over the years folks have developed many patterns, techniques and refactoring maneuvers. Some have been long forgotten, while others have stood the test of times.
Such a long-standing technique is dependency injection. It is a concept and a programming technique where a construct is passed (injected) to another construct that depends on it.
In Golang, like in other languages, we use it to simplify our code and make it more testable.</description>

          <title>Testing in Go: Fixtures</title>
          <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-fixtures/</link>

          <description>When I was researching the topic of test fixtures, I couldn&#39;t find much about their beginnings. My first search was about the name of the person who coined &amp;ldquo;test fixtures&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, that was not a fruitful edeavour. The next logical step was to look for etymology of the phrase &amp;ldquo;test fixtures&amp;rdquo;, but the only search result that made sense was a Wikipedia page on the topic.

          <title>Testing in Go: Subtests</title>
          <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-subtests/</link>

          <description>Before we begin: The content in this article assumes knowledge of table-driven tests in Go. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, read this article to familiarize yourself.
Image taken from Undraw.  With table-driven tests as the most popular testing approach, there is one annoying problem that every programmer will face: selective running of tests. That’s because the traditional approach of testing using table-driven tests in a single test function is not decomposable in granular subfunctions.</description>

          <title>Testing in Go: Table-Driven Tests</title>
          <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-table-driven-tests/</link>

          <guid>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-table-driven-tests/</guid>
          <description>Coming from Ruby, which has excellent testing tools and libraries, the notion of table-driven tests was unusual for me. The popular testing libraries in Ruby, like RSpec, force the programmer to approach testing from a BDD standpoint. Thus, coming to Go and learning about the table-driven test was definitely a new way of looking at tests for me.

          <description>As I was going down the stairs I remember feeling the temperature dropping. It was an astounding experience descending towards the basement in my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house – it felt cooler and quieter. The light was warm and dimmed, with creepy shadows dropping behind the old furniture that was serving its last years before getting disposed to the city cleaning service.

          <title>Testing in Go: Naming Conventions</title>
          <link>https://ieftimov.com/post/testing-in-go-naming-conventions/</link>

          <description>Programming languages and tools often have conventions. These conventions help make our work more straightforward. Just like all tools out there, Go also has some conventions when it comes to testing. Some are defined in the language itself (official), while others are coined by community members (unofficial).
In this article we will look at the naming conventions for files, functions and variables separately.

          <title>Testing in Go: Writing Practical Failure Messages</title>

          <description>All developers appreciate code that works, yet we spend much of our working hours debugging existing code. When fixing existing code, what our test failures communicate is paramount to the debugging experience we have.
That&#39;s why in this article we will look at what it means to write a meaningful test failure message. We will look at its structure and how we can use some simple techniques to improve our test failure messages.</description>

          <title>Testing in Go: Failing Tests</title>

          <description>In the previous article on testing in Golang, titled Testing in Go: First Principles, we looked at what testing looks like in Golang. In this article, we will do a deeper dive in the testing package. More specifically, we will take a look at the different ways we can fail tests in our test suites and when and how we should use these techniques.
Without further ado, let&#39;s take a look under the covers in the testing package.</description>

          <description>If you have any programming experience, whether that&#39;s as a student or a professional, there&#39;s a good chance you have heard about testing. It&#39;s an omnipresent topic, be it on conferences, books or articles. (See what I did there?)
Also, it seems like a topic that everyone agrees on - yes, testing is good and we should do it. There are many reasons why folks consider testing good for you code.</description>
