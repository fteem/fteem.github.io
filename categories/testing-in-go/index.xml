      <description>As I was going down the stairs I remember feeling the temperature dropping. It was an astounding experience descending towards the basement in my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house – it felt cooler and quieter. The light was warm and dimmed, with creepy shadows dropping behind the old furniture that was serving its last years before getting disposed to the city cleaning service.
One of the rooms in the basement was my grandfather’s workshop.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Crew, prepare for landing&amp;rdquo; echoed through the cabin. I looked out of the window and I saw the island – I was freaking out, but super excited at the same time. As a kid growing up in the Balkans, if you told me I would visit Bali one day I am sure I would not believe you for a second.
The first memory I have of walking in the hotel was the May heat and humidity.</description>

      <description>I remember it was summer and it the A/C was blasting in the office. My mentor and I were looking at one of the screens on my desk. It was the biggest screen I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on - a 24 inch 720p Dell. It meant a lot to me - I felt like a real programmer, whatever that means, looking at these vast areas of black screen and many split terminals, with tons of white characters on the black background.</description>

      <description>In the previous article on testing in Golang, titled Testing in Go: First Principles, we looked at what testing looks like in Golang. In this article, we will do a deeper dive in the testing package. More specifically, we will take a look at the different ways we can fail tests in our test suites and when and how we should use these techniques.
Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look under the covers in the testing package.</description>

      <description>If you have any programming experience, whether that&amp;rsquo;s as a student or a professional, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you have heard about testing. It&amp;rsquo;s an omnipresent topic, be it on conferences, books or articles. (See what I did there?)
Also, it seems like a topic that everyone agrees on - yes, testing is good and we should do it. There are many reasons why folks consider testing good for you code.</description>
