      <description>Imagine you just woke up, took a shower and you immediately go to your coffee machine to make that strong, large, morning, double-shot, extra-spice-and-everything-nice cup of coffee. Sure, you go to the machine, press some buttons and the next thing you know, you are waiting for the coffee to start pouring into your cup. And then, something&#39;s not right, and something starts to smell bad. A morning nightmare, right?

      <description>When testing our code, we usually go for the happy path (TM). We are awesome developers, we test our code, we are careful and there&#39;s no way our code might crash. Or not really? I often try to think of software as a live being. It thinks, it does stuff and sometimes it gets some things wrong. Just like us. We sometimes trip up while walking, we drop our keys or forget them on our desk at the office.</description>
