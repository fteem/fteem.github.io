          <description>Elixir is a really cool language. Although I do not have much experience with it (yet), I am always trying to build interesting stuff with it and learn the built-in tools. In this blog post I decided to show you how to build a self-contained command line application with Elixir, with some help from escript.
Escript Erlang and Elixir have this cool thing called escript. It&#39;s basically a tool that compiles an Elixir app that you have as a command line application.</description>
