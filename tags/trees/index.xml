      <description>You can spend quite a bit of your programming career without working with trees, or just by simply avoiding them if you donâ€™t understand them (which is what I had been doing for a while).
Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - arrays, lists, stacks and queues are quite powerful data structures and can take you pretty far, but there is a limit to their capabilities, how you can use them and how efficient that usage can be.</description>
