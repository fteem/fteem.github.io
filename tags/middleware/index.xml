          <description>In my last two posts about Rack, I wrote about the basics of Rack and how to write middleware. If you have no idea what this is about, I recommend reading the last two posts (in the order above). For the rest of you, carry on - today we will see how to write awesome Rails middleware and how to use it in any Rails application. Rails and Rack play together really nice, so keep on reading!</description>

          <description>Last time I wrote about the basics of Rack and writing a tiny Rack application. If you are unsure what Rack is and what is it&#39;s purpose, I recommend you read the other post, famirialize yourself with Rack and get back to this post. If you think you know enough about Rack, please, carry on reading.
Enter: Middleware So, middleware. Lets take it from the basics. What is middleware? Remember that Rack &amp;ldquo;wraps&amp;rdquo; HTTP requests and responses?</description>

          <description>About three years ago, when I started working with Ruby and Rails, I noticed that the term &amp;ldquo;Rack&amp;rdquo; always came up in my Google searches. Overwhelmed with all of the stuff I needed to learn combined with the awesomeness of Rails, which shields the new Rails devs from it&#39;s internals, I never really understood Rack or writing Rack apps. Although I used to see people mentioning &amp;ldquo;middleware&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Rack middleware&amp;rdquo; I never really wrote (or tried to write) any middleware.</description>
