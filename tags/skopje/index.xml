          <description>Startup - in my opinion it&#39;s the most ear-catching word nowadays. It represents growth, energy and, of course, billions of dollars. But yeah, a billion of dollars over a weekend is next to impossible. So, why would you attend a startup weekend? What&#39;s the benefit? Or, if you know the answers to these questions, you probably would like to know how to win? Yeah, everybody would like that&amp;hellip;
This year, it was my first time to attend a startup weekend and it happened in the city where I live - Skopje, Macedonia.</description>
