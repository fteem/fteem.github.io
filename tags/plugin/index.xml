      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that at this point Rubygems needs any introduction. Except if you have been living under a rock for the last 10 years or so. In that case, I think that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here reading this blog. You would be having a problem understanding why someone would like to share what they are eating, or what they are doing at the moment. For the rest of you, have you heard that Rubygems is extensible?</description>
