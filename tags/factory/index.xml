          <description>If you don&#39;t know the basics of AngularJS service, I recommend you read the other article I wrote on AngularJS Services Part 1: Provider.
Provider v.s. Factory Factory is a thin wrapper on top of Provider. While Provider provides us the ability to configure the service provider before injection (creating the service object), Factory lacks that ability.
Although it is short of this functionality, most of the Angular devs use factories because they are, in my opinion, the easiest to use and really cover all the general needs that one might need from a service.</description>
