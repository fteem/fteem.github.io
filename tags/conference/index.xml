      <description>This year&#39;s dotGo in Paris was awesome. The people were great in general. The organisers and volunteers did a good job. The attendees that I interacted with were cool – I had some interesting conversations and made couple of connections. The talks were informative and engaging. If this is where you stop reading, please give dotGo a shot next year - I am sure it will be great! And please find me in the crowd and talk to me, because I&#39;d love to talk to you.</description>
