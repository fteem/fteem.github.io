      <description>If you have ever tried writing a daemon for MacOS you have met with launchd. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t have the experience, think of it as a framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and scripts. If you have any *nix experience the word daemon should not be too alien to you.
For those unfamiliar, a daemon is a program running in the background without requiring user input.</description>
