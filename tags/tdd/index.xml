      <description>There are a lot of refactoring patterns available out there for us. I assume that most of us use these patterns, at certain times without being aware that those refactoring steps are defined as a pattern in the past.

Let&#39;s dive in!

Test Doubles So, first things first. One of the biggest misconceptions is that doubles are types of objects that are used in testing.</description>
