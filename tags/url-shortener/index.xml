      <description>Looking at any programming language you will (hopefully!) find a rich and useful standard library. I started my professional career as a software developer with Ruby, which has quite an easy-to-use and well-documented standard library with a plethora of modules and classes to use. Personally, I find the Enumerable module in Ruby with all its nice methods simply brilliant.
You might be coming from a different language, but I am sure that any serious programming language out there has a set of classes, modules, methods and functions to make your life (and work) easy.</description>
