      <description>Ruby on Rails as a framework does a lot of things for us developers. We get a very customizable middleware stack, great routing system, very expressive ORM, helpful modules with great utility methods in them and so on. But in Rails there&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye. It does some great things that we just take for granted or on occasions we don&amp;rsquo;t even know they exist.
Some of these features are TLS redirection, secure cookies and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</description>
