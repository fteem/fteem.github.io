Is it just hype? Well, I thought so at first, but I told myself &amp;ldquo;heck, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time, at least I&amp;rsquo;ll broaden my horizons&amp;rdquo;. Which, if you think about it, it not really is a waste of time.
Long story short, after couple of weeks of fiddling with the language, mostly by playing with it&amp;rsquo;s web framework I am delighted to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a really cool language that you should try out and also, I published a really small API wrapper for Elixir.</description></item></channel></rss>
